config BUILTIN
	bool "Support Builtin Applications"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable support for builtin applications.  This features assigns a string
		name to an application.  This feature is also the underlying requirement
		to support built-in applications in the NuttShell (NSH).

if BUILTIN

	config APPS_BINDIR
	bool "BINFS File System"
	default n
	---help---
		The BINFS file system is current just a toy.  The BINFS may, for example,
		be mount at /bin.  Then all of the built-in applications will appear as
		executable file in /bin if you list them from NSH like:

		nsh> ls -l /bin

		At present, the BINFS supports nothing more than that.  It is planned,
		however, to support execution of the builtin applications from BINFS as
		well (via a binfmt/ loader).  However, that is down the road.

config BUILTIN_PROXY_STACKSIZE
	int "Builtin Proxy Stack Size"
	default 1024
	---help---
		If exec_builting uses I/O redirection options, then it will require
		an intermediary/proxy task to muck with the file descriptors.  This
		configuration item specifies the stack size used for the proxy. Default:
		1024 bytes.
