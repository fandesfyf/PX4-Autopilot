  NuttX is a real timed embedded operating system (RTOS).

    <p>
      The goal is to provide implementations of most standard POSIX OS interfaces
      to support a rich, multi-threaded development environment for deeply embedded
      processors.
    </p>
      NON-GOALS: (1) It is not a goal to provide the level of OS features like those provided by Linux.
      In order to work with smaller MCUs, small footprint must be more important than an extensive feature set.
      But standard compliance is more important than small footprint.
      Surely a smaller RTOS could be produced by ignoring standards.
      Think of NuttX is a tiny Linux work-alike with a much reduced feature set.
      (2) There is no MMU-based support for processes.
      At present, NuttX assumes a flat address space.

    <p>
      Fully scalable from tiny (8-bit) to moderate embedded (32-bit).
      Scalability with rich feature set is accomplished with:
      Many tiny source files, link from static libraries, highly configurable, use of
      weak symbols when available.

    <p>
      NuttX strives to achieve a high degree of standards compliance.
      The primary governing standards are POSIX and ANSI standards.
      Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOS's are
      adopted for functionality not available under these standards
      or for functionality that is not appropriate for the deeply-embedded
      RTOS (such as <code>fork()</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this standards conformance, software developed under other
      standard OSs (such as Linux) should port easily to NuttX.

  <b>Look at all those files and features... How can it be a tiny OS?</b>.
  The NuttX feature list (above) is fairly long and if you look at the NuttX
  source tree, you will see that there are hundreds of source files comprising
  NuttX.  How can NuttX be a tiny OS with all of that?

    <p>
      The philosophy behind that NuttX is that lots of features are great... <i>BUT</i>
      also that if you don't use those features, then you should not have to pay a penalty
      for the unused features.
      And, with NuttX, you don't!  If you don't use a feature, it will not
      be included in the final executable binary.
      You only have to pay the penalty of increased footprint for the features
      that you actually use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a variety of technologies, NuttX can scale from the very tiny to
      the moderate-size system.  I have executed NuttX with some simple applications
      in as little as 32K <i>total</i> memory (code and data).
      On the other hand, typical, richly featured NuttX builds require more like 64K
      (and if all of the features are used, this can push 100K).

    <p>
      One may be intimidated by the size NuttX source tree.  There are hundreds of source files!
      How can that be a tiny OS?
      Actually, the large number of files is one of the tricks to keep NuttX small and
      as scalable as possible.
      Most files contain only a single function. 
      Sometimes just one tiny function with only a few lines of code.
      Why?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Static Libraries</b>.
        Because in the NuttX build processed, objects are compiled and saved into
        <i>static libraries</i> (<i>archives</i>).
        Then, when the file executable is linked, only the object files that are needed
        are extracted from the archive and added to the final executable.
        By having many, many tiny source files, you can assure that no code that you do
        not execute is ever included in the link.
        And by having many, tiny source files you have better granularity --
        if you don't use that tiny function of even just a few lines of code, it will
        not be included in the binary.

<tr>
  <td><br></td>
  <td>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, the use of many, tiny source files and linking from static
      libraries keeps the size of NuttX down.
      Other tricks used in NuttX include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
         <b>Configuration Files</b>.
         Before you build NuttX, you must provide a configuration file that specifies
         what features you plan to use and which features you do not.
         This configuration file contains a long list of settings that control
         what is built into NuttX and what is not.
         There are hundreds of such settings
         (see the <a href="NuttXPortingGuide.html#apndxconfigs">NuttX Porting Guide</a>
         for a partial list that excludes platform specific settings).
         These many, many configuration options allow NuttX to be highly tuned to
         meet size requirements.
         The downside to all of these configuration options is that it greatly
         complicates the maintenance of NuttX -- but that is my problem, not yours.
      </li>
      <li>
         <b>Weak Symbols</b>
         The GNU toolchain supports <i>weak</i> symbols and these also help to keep
         the size of NuttX down.
         Weak symbols prevent object files from being drawn into the link even if they
         are accessed from source code.
         Careful use of weak symbols is another trick for keep unused code out of the
         final binary.

  <b>Additional new features and extended functionality</b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>RTOS</b>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Implemented the POSIX <code>pause()</code> function (still has some compiance issues).
      </li>
      <li>
        Tasking logic is extended to support the notion of address environments.
        An address environment is the key notion underlying &quot;process&quot; vs. tasks.
        If tasks are created with address environments (by <code>binfmt</code>), the OS will propogate that environment to child threads and will destroy the address environment when all threads in the &quot;process&quot; exists.
      </li>
      <li>
        If support for the <code>PATH</code> variable is enabled, the OS start up logic will create an initial environment containing the default <code>PATH</code> setting (<code>CONFIG_PATH_INITIAL</code>).
        This initial <code>PATH</code> will then be inherited by all tasks.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b><code>Binfmt</code></b>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The NuttX binary loaders have been updated to support the <code>PATH</code> environment variable.
        Now, if the <code>PATH</code> is properly defined, programs can be executed from mass storage using only the file name.
        This feature is added to support more standard behavior (eventually, NSH will support execution of programs in file systems by just entering the file name, perhaps in 6.25?).
      </li>
      <li>
        The NXFLAT and ELF binary loaders have been extended to create address environments for any new tasks executed from the file system.
        This feature requires that the architecture support a memory management unit (MMU) and the address environment interfaces declared in <code>include/nuttx/arch.h</code> (currently, this is only supported by the z180).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>

        <code>stm32f4discovery/elf</code>: Now uses the <code>PATH</code> variable to find ELF executables.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>configs/cloudctrl</code>: Added for Darcy Gong's <i>CloudController</i> board
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>PIC32 Boards</b>:

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>ZiLOG</b>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add support for the z180 chip family and, specifically, for the P112 retro hardware (see <a href="http://p112.feedle.net/">http://p112.feedle.net/</a>).
      </li>
      <li>
        All ZiLOG configurations updated to use the current ZDS-II and/or SDCC toolchains.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Graphics</b>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add a semaphore handshake so that operations on buffers from the NXMU client will be blocked until the NX server operates on the buffer data (from Petteri Aimonen).
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>nxtk_subwindowmove()</code> and <code>nxtk_getwindow()</code>: Improvements to clipping logic from Petteri Aimonen.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>C Library</b>:
      <code>lib/</code> sub-directory renamed <code>libc/</code> (there is a new <code>lib/</code> sub-directory that is used to hold all archives).
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>C++</b>:
      Exception stubs from Petteri Aimonen.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Applications</b>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add NSH hexdump command to dump the contents of a file (or character device) to the console (contributed by Petteri Aimonen).
      </li>
      <li>
        Extend the NSH <code>ifconfig</code> command plus various DHCPC improvements (from Darcy Gong).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>apps/examples</b>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>ostest</code>: Replace large tables with algorithmic prime number generation.
        This allows the roundrobin test to run on platforms with minimal SRAM (Freddie Chopin).
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>keypadtest</code>:  A new keypad test example contributed by Denis Carikli.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>elf</code> and <code>nxflat</code>:  If <code>CONFIG_BINFMT_EXEPATH</code> is defined, these examples will now use a relative path to the program and expect the <code>binfmt/</code> logic to find the absolute path to the program using the <code>PATH</code> variable.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Build system</b>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          New top-level Makefiles: <code>Makefile.unix</code> and <code>Makefile.win</code> (along with numerous changes to other make-related files).
          This adds basic support for building NuttX natively under from Windows console (rather than in a POSIX-like environment).
          This build: (1) Uses all Windows style paths, (2) Uses primarily standard Windows batch commands  with (3) a few additional commands from <i>GNUWin32</i> (such as GNU make).
        </p>
        <p>
          This capability should still be considered a work in progress because: (1) It has not been verfied on all targets and tools, and (2) it still lacks some of the creature-comforts of the more mature environments (like a functional <code>configure.sh</code> script and <code>make menuconfig</code> support).
      </li>
      <li>
        Example Windows native builds for STM32F4Discovery, eZ80, z16f, z8, Z80, and Z180.
      </li>
      <li>
        Several configurations have been converted to work the <code>kconfig-frontends</code> <code>mconf</code> configuration tool: <code>stm32f4discovery/nxlines</code>, and all eZ80, z16f, z8, Z80, and Z180 configurations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Architectures now include a common <code>Toolchain.defs</code> file that can be used to manage toolchains in a more configurable way (most of this contributed by Mike Smith).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Build tools</b>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Renamed <code>tools/winlink.sh</code> to <code>tools/copydir.sh</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Several new tools/scripts to support the Windows native build: <code>tools/mkdeps.bat</code>, <code>tools/mkdeps.c</code>, <code>tools/link.bat</code>, <code>tools/unlink.bat</code>, and <code>tools/ copydir.bat</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>tools/incdir.sh</code> and <code>tools/incdir.bat</code> now support an <code>-s</code> option to generate system header file paths.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>tools/b16.c</code>: Fixed precision math conversion utility.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>Bugfixes</b> (see the change log for details).

      This port uses the <a href="http://www.atmel.com/">Atmel</a> SAM3U-EK
      development board that features the AT91SAM3U4E MCU.
      This port uses a GNU arm-nuttx-elf or arm-eabi toolchain* under either Linux or Cygwin (with native Windows GNU tools or Cygwin-based GNU tools).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p>
        <b>STATUS:</b>
        The basic SAM3U-EK port was released in NuttX version 5.1. The basic port includes boot-up
        logic, interrupt driven serial console, and system timer interrupts.
        That release passes the NuttX OS test and is proven to have a valid OS implementation.
        A configuration to support the NuttShell is also included.
        NuttX version 5.4 adds support for the HX8347 LCD on the SAM3U-EK board.
        This LCD support includes an example using the
        <a href=" http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NXGraphicsSubsystem.html">NX graphics system</a>.
        NuttX version 6.10 adds SPI support.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subsequent NuttX releases will extend this port and add support for SDIO-based SD cards and
        USB device (and possible LCD support).
        These extensions may or may not happen soon as my plate is kind of full now.

          This includes verified support for:  SYSTICK system time,  pin and GPIO configuration, and a serial console.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several drivers have been copied from the related LPC17xx port but require integration into the LPC43xx:  ADC, DAC, GPDMA, I2C, SPI, and SSP.
          The registers for these blocks are the same in both the LPC43xx and the LPC17xx and they should integrate into the LPC43xx very easily by simply adapting the clocking and pin configuration logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other LPC17xx drivers were not brought into the LPC43xx port because these peripherals have been completely redesigned:  CAN, Ethernet, USB device, and USB host.
        </p>
        <p>
          So then there is no support for the following LPC43xx peripherals: SD/MMC, EMC, USB0,USB1, Ethernet, LCD, SCT, Timers 0-3, MCPWM, QEI, Alarm timer, WWDT, RTC, Event monitor, and CAN.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these can be leveraged from other MCUs that appear to support the same peripheral IP:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The LPC43xx USB0 peripheral appears to be the same as the USB OTG peripheral for the LPC31xx.
              The LPC31xx USB0 device-side driver has been copied from the LPC31xx port but also integration into the LPC43xx (clocking and pin configuration).
              It should be possible to complete poriting of this LPC31xx driver with a small porting effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Ethernet block looks to be based on the same IP as the STM32 Ethernet and, as a result, it should be possible to leverage the NuttX STM32 Ethernet driver with a little more effort.
            </li>

      This board was developed by <a href="http://pjrc.com/teensy/">PJRC</a>.
      The Teensy++ 2.0 is based on an Atmel AT90USB1286 MCU.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p>
       <b>STATUS:</b>
         The basic port was released in NuttX-6.5.  This basic port consists of
         a &quot;Hello, World!!&quot; example that demonstrates initialization of the OS,
         creation of a simple task, and serial console output as well as a somewhat
         simplified NuttShell (NSH) configuration (see the
         <a href="http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html">NSH User Guide</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
         An SPI driver and a USB device driver exist for the AT90USB as well
         as a USB mass storage configureation.  However, this configuration is not
         fully debugged as of the NuttX-6.5 release.

    <p><b>AVR-Specific Issues</b>.
      The basic AVR port is solid and biggest issue for using AVR is its tiny SRAM memory and its Harvard architecture.
      Because of the Harvard architecture, constant data that resides to flash is inaccessible using &quot;normal&quot; memory reads and writes (only SRAM data can be accessed &quot;normally&quot;).
      Special AVR instructions are available for accessing data in FLASH, but these have not been integrated into the normal, general purpose OS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most NuttX test applications are console-oriented with lots of strings used for printf and debug output.
      These strings are all stored in SRAM now due to these data accessing issues and even the smallest console-oriented applications can quickly fill a 4-8K memory.
      So, in order for the AVR port to be useful, one of two things would need to be done:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Don't use console applications that required lots of strings.
        The basic AVR port is solid and your typical deeply embedded application should work fine.
        Or,
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a special version of printf that knows how to access strings that reside in FLASH (or EEPROM).
      </li>
    </ol>

      <b>AV32DEV1</b>.
      This port uses the www.mcuzone.com AVRDEV1 board based on the Atmel AT32UC3B0256 MCU.
      This port requires a special GNU avr32 toolchain available from atmel.com website.
      This is a windows native toolchain and so can be used only under Cygwin on Windows.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p>
       <b>STATUS:</b>
         This port is has completed all basic development, but there is more that needs to be done.
         All code is complete for the basic NuttX port including header files for all AT32UC3* peripherals.
         The untested AVR32 code was present in the 5.12 release of NuttX.
         Since then, the basic RTOS port has solidified:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The port successfully passes the NuttX OS test (apps/examples/ostest).
        </li>
        <li>
          A NuttShell (NSH) configuration is in place (see the <a href="http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html">NSH User Guide</a>).
          Testing of that configuration has been postponed (because it got bumped by the Olimex LPC1766-STK port).
          Current Status: I think I have a hardware problem with my serial port setup.
          There is a good chance that the NSH port is complete and functional, but I am not yet able to demonstrate that.
          At present, I get nothing coming in the serial RXD line (probably because the pins are configured wrong or I have the MAX232 connected wrong).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The basic, port (including the verified apps/examples/ostest configuration) was be released in NuttX-5.13.
        A complete port will include drivers for additional AVR32 UC3 devices -- like SPI and USB --- and will be available in a later release,
        time permitting.

        <b>STATUS:</b>
        Integration and testing of NuttX on the  ZiLOG ez80f0910200zcog-d is complete.
        The first integrated version was released in NuttX version 0.4.2 (with important early bugfixes
        in 0.4.3 and 0.4.4).
        As of this writing, that port provides basic board support with a serial console, SPI, and eZ80F91 EMAC driver.

    <p>
      This is a tougher environment.
      In this case, the Windows native toolchain is unaware of the
      Cygwin <i>sandbox</i> and, instead, operates in the native Windows environment.
      The primary difficulties with this are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Paths</b>.
        Full paths for the native toolchain must follow Windows standards.
        For example, the path <code>/home/my\ name/nuttx/include</code> my have to be
        converted to something like <code>'C:\cygwin\home\my name\nuttx\include'</code>
        to be usable by the toolchain.
      </li>
      <p>
        Fortunately, this conversion is done simply using the <code>cygpath</code> utility.
      </p>
      <li>
        <b>Symbolic Links</b>
        NuttX depends on symbolic links to install platform-specific directories in the build system.
        On Linux, true symbolic links are used.
        On Cygwin, emulated symbolic links are used.
        Unfortunately, for native Windows applications that operate outside of the
        Cygwin <i>sandbox</i>, these symbolic links cannot be used.
      </li>
      <p>
        The NuttX make system works around this limitation by copying the platform
        specific directories in place.
        These copied directories make work a little more complex, but otherwise work well.
      </p>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: In this environment, it should be possible to use the NTFS <code>mklink</code> command to create links.
        This should only require a minor modification to the build scripts (see <code>tools/copydir.sh</code> script).
      </small></p>
      <li>
        <b>Dependencies</b>
        NuttX uses the GCC compiler's <code>-M</code> option to generate make dependencies.  These
        dependencies are retained in files called <code>Make.deps</code> throughout the system.
        For compilers other than GCC, there is no support for making dependencies in this way.
        For Windows native GCC compilers, the generated dependencies are windows paths and not
        directly usable in the Cygwin make.  By default, dependencies are surpressed for these
        compilers as well.
      </li>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: dependencies are suppress by setting the make variable <code>MKDEPS</code> to point
        to the do-nothing dependency script, <code>tools/mknulldeps.sh</code>.
      </small></p>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Supported Windows Native Toolchains</b>.
      At present, the following Windows native toolchains are in use:
      <ol>
        <li>GCC built for Windows (such as CodeSourcery, Atollic, devkitARM, etc.),</li>
        <li>SDCC built for Windows,</li>
        <li> the ZiLOG XDS-II toolchain for Z16F, z8Encore, and eZ80Acclaim parts.</li>

      This capability first appeared in NuttX-6.24 and should still be considered a work in progress because: (1) it has not been verfied on all targets and tools, and (2) still lacks some of the creature-comforts of the more mature environments.

        The build must be performed in a Windows console window.
        This may be using the standard <code>CMD.exe</code> terminal that comes with Windows.
        I prefer the ConEmu terminal which can be downloaded from:
        http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>GNUWin32</b>.
        The build still relies on some Unix-like commands.
        I usethe GNUWin32 tools that can be downloaded from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/.
        See the top-level <code>nuttx/README.txt</code> file for some download, build, and installation notes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>MinGW-GCC</b>.
        MinGW-GCC is used to compiler the C tools in the <code>nuttx/tools</code> directory that are neede by the build.
        MinGW-GCC can be downloaded from http://www.mingw.org/.
        If you are using GNUWin32, then it is recommendedthe you not install the optional MSYS components as there may be conflicts.

      I've never tried this one, but I off the following reported by an ez80 user using the ZiLOG ZDS-II Windows-native toolchain:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         &quot;I've installed ZDS-II 5.1.1 (IDE for ez80-based boards) on wine (windows emulator for UNIX) and to my surprise, not many changes were needed to make SVN snapshot of NuttX buildable...
         I've tried nsh profile and build process completed successfully.
         One remark is necessary: NuttX makefiles for ez80 are referencing <code>cygpath</code> utility.
         Wine provides similar thing called <code>winepath</code> which is compatible and offers compatible syntax.
         To use that, <code>winepath</code> (which itself is a shell script) has to be copied as <code>cygpath</code> somewhere in <code>$PATH</code>, and edited as in following patch:
       </p>
       <ul><pre>

</pre></ul>
      <p>
        &quot;Better solution would be replacing all <code>cygpath</code> references in  <code>Makefiles </code> with  <code>$(CONVPATH)</code> (or  <code>${CONVPATH}</code> in shell scripts) and setting <code>CONVPATH</code> to  <code>cygpath</code> or  <code>winepath</code> regarding to currently used environment.

      <b>Environment Dependencies</b>.
      The primary environmental dependency of NuttX are (1) GNU make,
      (2) bash scripting, and (3) Linux utilities (such as cat, sed, etc.).
      If you have other platforms that support GNU make or make
      utilities that are compatible with GNU make, then it is very
      likely that NuttX would work in that environment as well (with some
      porting effort). If GNU make is not supported, then some significant
      modification of the Make system would be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MSYS</b>.
      I have not used MSYS but what I gather from talking with NuttX users is that MSYS can be used as an alternative to Cygwin in any of the above Cygwin environments.
      This is not surprising since MSYS is based on an older version of Cygwin (cygwin-1.3).
      MSYS has been modified, however, to interoperate in the Windows environment better than Cygwin and that may be of value to some users.
    </p>
    <p>
      MSYS, however, cannot be used with the native Windows NuttX build because it will invoke the MSYS bash shell instead of the <code>CMD.exe</code> shell.
      Use GNUWin32 in the native Windows build envionment.

    * arch/arm/src/stm32:  Support for STM32F100 high density chips
      added by Freddie Chopin.
    * configs/stm32f100_generic:  Support for generic STM32F100RC board
      contributed by Freddie Chopin.
    * arch/arm/src/stm32_otgfsdev.c:  Partial fix from Petteri Aimonen.
    * drivers/lcd/ug-2864ambag01.c and include/nuttx/lcd/ug_2864ambag01.h:
      LCD driver for the Univision OLED of the same name (untested on
      initial check-in).
    * configs/stm32f4discovery/nxlines:  Configure to use mconf/Kconfig
      tool.
    * configs/stm32f4discovery/src/up_ug2864ambag01.c:  Board-specific
      initialization for UG-2864AMBAG01 OLED connecte to STM32F4Disovery.
    * libxx/libxx_stdthrow.cxx:  Exception stubs from Petteri Aimonen.
    * configs/stm32f4discovery/src/up_ug2864ambag01.c: Driver has been
      verified on the STM32F4Discovery platform.  Some tuning of the
      configuration could improve the presentation.  Lower resolution displays
      are also more subject to the &quot;fat, flat line bug&quot; that I need to fix
      someday.  See http://www.nuttx.org/doku.php?id=wiki:graphics:nxgraphics
      for a description of the fat, flat line bug.
    * libc:  Renamed nuttx/lib to nuttx/libc to make space for a true lib/
      directory that will be forthcoming.  Also rename libraries:  liblib.a -&gt; libc.a,
      libulib.a -&gt; libuc.a, libklib.a -&gt; libkc.a, liblibxx.a -&gt;libcxx.a.
      (I will probably, eventually rename libxx to libcxx for consistency)
    * Makefile, lib/: A new, empty directory that will hold generated libraries.
      This simplifies the library patch calculations and lets me get rid of some
      bash logic.  The change is functional, but only partially complete;
      additional logic is needed in the arch/*/src/Makefile's as well.  Right
      now that logic generate multiple library paths, all pointing to the lib/
      directory.
    * arch/*/src/Makefile:  Now uses only the libraries in lib/
      Replace bash fragments that test for board/Makefile.
    * Makefile.win:  The beginnings of a Windows-native build.  This is just
      the beginning and not yet ready for prime time use.
    * configs/stm32f4discovery/winbuild:  This is a version of the standard
      NuttX OS test, but configured to build natively on Windows.  Its only
      real purpose is to very the native Windows build logic.
    * tools/mkdeps.bat and tools/mkdeps.c:  mkdeps.bat is a failed attempt
      to leverage mkdeps.sh to CMD.exe.  It fails because the are certain
      critical CFLAG values that cannot be passed on the CMD.exe command line
      (like '=').  mkdeps.c is a work in progress that will, hopefully,
      replace both mkdeps.sh and mkdeps.bat.
    * tools/Config.mk:  Centralize the definition of the script that will be
      used to generated header file include paths for the compiler.  This
      needs to be centralized in order to support the Windows native build.
    * tools/incdir.bat:  A replacement for tools/incdir.sh for use with the
      the Windows native build.
    * Makefile.unix:  The existing top-level Makefile has been renamed
      Makefile.unix.
    * Makefile:  This is a new top-level Makefile that just includes
      either Makefile.unix or Makefile.win
    * configs/stm3240g-eval/src:  Qencoder fixes from Ryan Sundberg.
    * arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_qencoder.c: TIM3 bug fix from Ryan Sundberg.
    * tools/mkromfsimg.sh: Correct typo in an error message (Ryan Sundberg)
    * arch/*/src/Makefile:  Remove tftboot install and creation of System.map
      for Windows native build.  The first is a necessary change, the second
      just needs re-implemented.
    * configs/mirtoo: Update Mirtoo pin definitions for Release 2.  Provided
      by Konstantin Dimitrov.
    * Fixed an uninitialized variable in the file system that can cause 
      assertions if DEBUG on (contributed by Lorenz Meier).
    * Config.mk:  Defined DELIM to be either / or \, depending upon
      CONFIG_WINDOWS_NATIVE.  This will allow me to eliminate a lot of
      conditional logic elsewhere.
    * nuttx/graphics: One a mouse button is pressed, continue to report all
      mouse button events to the first window that received the the initial
      button down event, even if the mouse attempts to drag outside the
      window. From Petteri Aimonen.
    * nuttx/graphics/nxmu/nx_block.c:  One more fix to the NX block message
      logic from Petteri Aimonen.
    * include/nuttx/wqueue.h: Some basic definitions to support a user-
      space work queue (someday in the future).
    * graphics/nxmu:  Add semaphores so buffers messages that send buffers
      will block until the buffer data has been acted upon.
    * graphics/nxmw:  Extended the blocked messages to cover mouse movement
      and redraw events.  These will also cause problems if sent to a window
      while it is closing.
    * arch/several:  Change UARTs are enabled for i.MX, LM3S, ez80, and M16C to
      match how they are enabled for other architectures.
    * configs/ez80f910200kitg:  Convert to use mconf configuration.
    * sched/pause.c:  Implements the POSIX pause() function.
    * ez80: Lots of changes to ez80 configurations and build logic as I
      struggle to get a clean Windows build (still not working).
    * configs/cloudctrl:   Darcy Gong's CloudController board.  This is a
      small network relay development board. Based on the Shenzhou IV development
      board design.  It is based on the STM32F107VC MCU.
    * arch/arm/src/stm32_serial.c and stm32_lowputc.c:  Added optional RS-485
      direction bit control. From Freddie Chopin.
    * Lots of build files:  ARMv7-M and MIPS32 Make.defs now include a common
      Toolchain.defs file that can be used to manage toolchains in a more
      configurable way.  Contributed by Mike Smith
    * configs/stm32f4discovery/winbuild and configs/cloudctrl:  Adapted to use
      Mike's Toolchain.defs.
    * tools/configure.sh:  Adapted to handle paths and setenv.bat files correctly
      for native Windows builds.
    * More of build files:  AVR and AVR32 Make.defs now include a common
      Toolchain.defs file that can be used to manage toolchains in a more
      configurable way.  Contributed by Mike Smith
    * tools/incdir.sh and incdir.bat: Add -s option to generate system header
      file paths.
    * nuttx/arch/arm/src/arm/Toolchain.defs: Add support for more ARM toolchains
      (from Mike Smith).
    * arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32f40xxx_rcc.c:  Enabled FLASH prefetch (from Petteri
      Aimonen).
    * graphics/nxtk/nxtk_filltrapwindow.c:  Correct an offset problem (from
      Peterri Aimonen).
    * graphics/nxglib/nxglib_splitline.c:  Fix error in drawing of near horizontal
      lines (from Peterri Aimonen).
    * sched/task_exithook.c:  Missing right bracket with certain conditional
      compilation (thanks James Goppert).
    * arch/arm/srch/stm32/stm32_otgfshost.c:  Replace timeout handling; use
      system tick instead of frame counter.  The frame counter gets reset to
      zero at 0x3fff making it error prone.
    * arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32f20xx_rcc.c and stm32f40xx_rcc.c: Added option
      CONFIG_STM32_FLASH_PREFETCH.  FLASH prefetch will now only be enabled
      if this option is selected.
    * confgs/ez80f910200zco/ostest:  Now uses Kconfig/mconf configuration
      tool. Updated to build in native Windows environment.  Other ez80f910200zco
      build scripts also updated.
    * configs/z8f64200100kit/ostest: Update to same level as ez80 configurations.
    * nuttx/configs/z8f64200100kit/scripts/setenv.bat: Add support for native
      Windows build.
    * nuttx/arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_i2c.c: Resources not being released when
      I2C is uninitialized.
    * cloudctrl/src/up_chipid.c and shenzhou/src/up_chipid.c:  Add functions to
      get chip ID.  Contributed by Darcy Gong.  These should not be board-dependent,
      but should be in arch/arm/src/stm32 where they can be used from any board.
    * sched/work_thread.c: Fix backward conditional compilation.  This might
      has caused a memory leak.  From Freddie Chopin.
    * configs/&lt;many&gt;/Make.defs:  Fix typo -wstrict-prototypes should be
      -Wstrict-prototypes (From Denis Carilki).
    * arch/arm/src/calapyso/calypso_keypad.c:  Add Calypso keypad driver.  From
      Denis Carilki.
    * z8encore000zco/ostest and z8f64200100kit/ostest:  Converted to use Kconfig/
      mconf configuration tool.
    * arch/arm/src/armv7-m/up_exception.S: missing curly braces for push/pop
      From Freddie Chopin.
    * z8encore000zco/ostest and z8f64200100kit/ostest:  Can now be modified to
      support the Windows native builds (see corresponding README.txt files).
    * configs/z16f2800100zcog - All configurations updated to use the ZDS-II
      5.0.1 toolchain.
    * configs/z16f2800100zcog - All configurations updated to use Kconfig/mconf
      configuration tools.
    * configs/z16f2800100zcog/ostest - Now supports a native Windows build
      (other ZNEO configs may also support the native build, but this has not
      been verfiied).
    * include/nuttx/input/keypad.h, arch/arm/src/calypso/calypso_keypad.c, and
      configs/compal_e99/nsh_highram: First cut at a standard keypad interface
      definition.  Contributed by Denis Carikli.
    * libc/stdlib/lib_rand.c:  Always add one to result congruential generators
      to avoid the value zero.  Suggested by Freddie Chopin.
    * tools/b16.c:  Fixed precision math conversion utility.
    * graphics/nxglib/nxglib_splitline.c:  Fix the &quot;fat, flat line bug&quot;
    * arch/z80/src/*/Toolchain.defs:  Add dummy Toolchain.defs files for the
      z80 family.
    * configs/z80sim/ostest:  Converted to build with the Kconfig/mconf tool.
      Current configuration failed to build for me (Ubuntu 12.10, SDCC 3.2.0
      pre-built for Linux) due to a glibc memory corruptionerror in SDCC.
    * configs/z80sim/ostest: Default is now the Windows native build.  See
      configs/z80sim/README.txt for instructions to convert back to a Linux or
      or Cygwin build.
    * arch/z80/src/Makefile.sdccw:  Renamed makefiles with extensions zdiil,
      zdiiw, sdccl, and sdccw for the ZDS-II vs SDCC compilers and for the
      POSIX vs Windows native builds.
    * nuttx/drivers/mtd/ftl.c:  Fix for the flash translation layer. Short
      unaligned writes were buggy.  From Petteri Aimonen.
    * nuttx/libc/math/lib_round*.c:  Add rounding functions to the math
      library.  Contributed by Petteri Aimonen.
    * include/cxx/cstdlib:  Add stroul().  From Petteri Aimonen.
    * arch/*/include/limits.h:  Change signed minimum values from, for example,
      (-128) to (-127 - 1) to avoid overflows under certain conditions.  From
      Peterri Aimonen.
    * graphics/nxtk/nxtk_subwindowmove.c: Previously it was very difficult to
      do e.g. &quot;scroll by dx, dy&quot;. When given the full window area, nxtk_subwindowmove
      would clip the offset always to 0,0. It makes more sense for it to clip the
      source area and not modify the offset.  From Petteri Aimonen.
    * graphics/nxtk/nxtk_getwindow.c: Clipping would change the offset of returned
      data, and caller has no way to know what the new offset would be. This messes
      up font drawing when the text is partially out of window, e.g. when scrolling.
      Also from Petteri Aimonen.
    * include/stdbool.h: Can now be disabled for C++ files if CONFIG_C99_BOOL8 is
      defined.  CONFIG_C99_BOOL8 indicates (1) that the sizeof(_Bool) is one in both
      C and C++, and (2) the the C compiler is C99 and supports the _Bool intrinsic
      type. Requested by Freddie Chopin.
    * include/stdlib/lib_rand.c:  Various additional changes so that the integer
      value zero can be returned.  Requested by Freddie Chopin.
    * arch/z80/src/Makefile.sdcc*, z80/up_mem.h:  Redesign Z80 build so that it
      no longer depends on Bash scripts.
    * configs/z80sim/nsh and pashello:  Converted to (1) use the kconfig-frontends
      configuration tool, and (2) to build natively under Windows.  The NSH
      configuration is verified; the pashello configuration needs a more TLC.
    * tools/copydir.sh:  Rename tools/winlink.sh to tools/copydir.sh
    * tools/link.bat, unlink.bat, and copydir.bat:  Add Windows counterparts
      to the link.sh, unlink.sh, and copydir.sh Bash scripts.
    * configs/z80sim/pashello:  Now builds correctly.
    * configs/xtrs/ostest, nsh, and pashello:  Converted to (1) use the kconfig-
      frontends configuration tool, and (2) to build natively under Windows.
    * drivers/serial/Kconfig and sched/Kconfig:  Two names for same configuration:
      CONFIG_LOWLEVEL_CONSOLE is bogus and CONFIG_DEV_LOWCONSOLE is in the wrong
      Kconfig file.  Moved to drivers/serial/Kconfig replacing CONFIG_LOWLEVEL_CONSOLE.
    * arch/z80/include/z180:  Add header files for z180 chips.  Initial versions
      are just clones of z80 header files.
    * arch/z80/src/z180:  Add source files for z180 chips.  Initial versions
      are just clones of z80 source files.
    * include/nuttx/arch.h:  Add address environment control interfaces (for use
      with CPUs the provide MCUs and support process-like address environments).
    * arch/z80/src/z180/z180_mmu.*:  Add MMU support for z180 tasks.
    * configs/p112:  Add very basic board support and an examples/ostest
      configuration for the venerable P112 board.
    * sched/os_bringup.c: If CONFIG_PATH_INITIAL is defined, then the initial
      environment of the task started by os_bringup() will have the PATH
      environment variable defined to be that string.
    * binfmt/binfmt_exepath.c:  If CONFIG_BINFMT_EXEPATH is defined, then this
      file will be built.  It contains logic to search for regular files at
      the absolutes paths found in the current PATH environment variable
      setting.  This is untested and not yet hooked into the binfmt exec()
      logic on initial check-in
    * binfmt/binfmt_loadmodule.c: load_module() will now traverse the PATH
      variable to locate files from their relative path.
    * include/nuttx/arch.h and arch/z80/src/z180/z180_mmu.c:  Restructure the
      address environment interfaces so that they will better integrate with
      binfmt/.
    * binfmt/libelf/*, binfmt/libnxflat/* and other files:  Integrate the
      address environment interfaces.  If CONFIG_ADDRENV=y, then binfmt/
      will now create an address environment for new tasks (instead of
      just malloc'ing the task memory).
    * configs/stm32f4discovery/elf:  Enable support/test of the PATH
      to find executables using a relative path.

apps-6.24 2012-12-20 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * apps/examples/ostest/roundrobin.c:  Replace large tables with
      algorithmic prime number generation.  This allows the roundrobin
      test to run on platforms with minimal SRAM (Freddie Chopin).
    * apps/nshlib/nsh_dbgcmds.c:  Add hexdump command to dump the contents
      of a file (or character device) to the console  Contributed by Petteri
      Aimonen.
    * apps/examples/modbus:  Fixes from Freddie Chopin
    * apps/examples/modbus/Kconfig: Kconfig logic for FreeModBus contributed
      by Freddie Chopin.
    * Makefile, */Makefile:  Various fixes for Windows native build.  Now uses
      make foreach loops instead of shell loops.
    * apps/examples/elf/test/*/Makefile: OSX doesn't support install -D, use
      mkdir -p then install without the -D.  From Mike Smith.
    * apps/examples/relays/Makefile: Reduced stack requirement (Darcy Gong).
    * apps/nshlib and apps/netutils/dhcpc:  Extend the NSH ifconfig command plus
      various DHCPC improvements(Darcy Gong).
    * apps/nshlib/nsh_apps.c: Fix compilation errors when CONFIG_NSH_DISABLEBG=y.
      From Freddie Chopin.
    * Rename CONFIG_PCODE and CONFIG_FICL as CONFIG_INTERPRETERS_PCODE and
      CONFIG_INTERPRETERS_FICL for consistency with other configuration naming.
    * apps/examples/keypadtest:  A keypad test example contributed by Denis
      Carikli.
    * apps/examples/elf and nxflat:  If CONFIG_BINFMT_EXEPATH is defined, these
      tests will now use a relative path to the program and expect the binfmt/
      logic to find the absolute path to the program using the PATH variable.

NxWidgets-1.4 2012-12-20 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * libnxwidgets/Makefile, NxWidgets/nxwm/Makefile, and
      NxWidgets/UnitTests/nxwm/Makefile:  Makefile improvements from
      submitted by Petteri Aimonen.  Other Makefiles in the UnitTests
      directory probably also need these changes.
    * libnxwidgets/src/ccallback.cxx: Fix misplaced #endif.  Provided
      by Petteri Aimonen.
    * libnxwidgets/src/cnxserver.cxx:  Reduce delay to allow NX server
      to start.  One second was un-necessarily long.  Reduced to 50 MS.
      Reduction suggested by Petteri Aimonen.
    * tools/bitmap_converter.py:  This script converts from any image type
      supported by Python imaging library to the RLE-encoded format used by
      NxWidgets.
    * NxWidgets/nxwm/src/capplicationwindow.cxx: If the &quot;desktop&quot; is empty,
      users have no need to minimize any windows. If the buttons are small,
      it's easy to hit minimize button accidentally when trying to close an
      application.  Contributed by Petteri Aimonen.
    * NxWidgets/nxwm/src/ctaskbar.cxx:  Add an option to eliminate the
      background image.  Contributed by Petteri Aimonen.
    * NxWidgets/nxwm/src/chexcalculator.cxx and NxWidgets/nxwm/src/cstartwindow.cxx:
      The config settings CONFIG_NXWM_STARTWINDOW_ICON and CONFIG_NXWM_HEXCALCULATOR_ICON
      allow changing the icons used for these applications. However, to declare symbols
      for these icons user would need to modify NxWidgets header files.
      This commit adds a simple forward declaration to the relevant files, based on the
      configured icon. If the icon does not exist, linker will give an error about it.
      Contributed by Petteri Aimonen.
    * NxWidgets::CTaskBar: Highlight the current window in the task bar.
      Contributed by Petteri Aimonen.
    * NxWidgets/libnxwidgets/src/glyph_cycle.cxx:  Width of glyph_cycle was wrong;
      Destructor needs to by public.  From Petteri Aimonen.
    * NxWidgets::CNumericEdit.  This is basically a label with plus and minus buttons.
      Contributed by Petteri, Aimonen.
    * NxWM::CStartWindow:  Fix mq_receive error handling with signal is recieved.
      From Petteri Aimonen.
    * NxWidgets::CNxTimer:  Replace the original (apparently non-functional) signal-
      based solution with a work queue-based solution.  This raises some isses about
      using the internal work queues from user space.  I have decided to implemented
      user-space work queues (someday) in order to accomplish that functionaliy.
      Submitted by Petteri Aimonen.
    * NxWidgets:CText and NxWidgets:CNumericEdite:  Fix some memory freeing bugs
      (from Petteri Aimonen).
    * NxWidgets::CScrollingPanel:  Usability improvements.  It is borderless for now,
      because there was no easy way to redraw only the required part of the border.
      Contributed by Petteri Aimonen.
    * NxWidgets::CNxWidgets and NxWM::CStartWindow: Small changes to make sub-
      classing easier (from Petteri Aimonen).

uClibc++-1.0 2011-11-05 &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * The initial release of the uClibc++ implementation of the standard
      C++ library for NuttX.  This package was contributed ay Qiang Yu and
      David for the RGMP team.

buildroot-1.11 2011-11-05 &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * configs/avr-defconfig-4.3.3 - Added --enable-long-long as a GCC
      option.
    * configs/avr-defconfig-4.5.2 - New configuration.
    * Config.in and almost all configurations in configs/ - Changed the
      default nuttx path to $(TOPDIR)/../../nuttx
    * Misc files.  Patch provided by Gerd v. Egidy that solves the following
      problems
      - binutils 2.21 is not available on the gnu servers anymore, they replaced
        it with 2.21.1
      - there is some assembler error when compiling gcc for arm, gcc bugzilla
        43999
      - you can't build nuttx for cortex m3/m4 because of a missing instruction
        in the assembler, binutils bugzilla 12296
    * Add support for binutils 2.22 and GCC 4.6.3.
    * Change name of all tools from xxx-elf to xxx-nuttx-elf
    * Added an ARM EABI GCC 4.6.3 configuration (tool name is arm-nuttx-eabi-).
    * ldnxflat: Add support for the R_ARM_REL32 relocation.  This relocation
      type was not generated by GCC/LD prior to gcc-4.6.3
    * R_ARM_REL32 logic is conditionally disabled because it has not been
      tested.
    * ldnxflat: Correct a memory allocation error that could cause written
      past the end of allocated memory.  Partial restoration of R_ARM_REL32
      logic.  There are lots of issues that I still do not understand here.

pascal-3.0 2011-05-15 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * nuttx/:  The Pascal add-on module now installs and builds under the
      apps/interpreters directory.  This means that the pascal-2.1 module is
      incompatible with will all releases of NuttX prior to nuttx-6.0 where the 
      apps/ module was introduced.
