  NuttX is a real timed embedded operating system (RTOS).

    <p>
      The goal is to provide implementations of most standard POSIX OS interfaces
      to support a rich, multi-threaded development environment for deeply embedded
      processors.
    </p>
      NON-GOALS: (1) It is not a goal to provide the level of OS features like those provided by Linux.
      In order to work with smaller MCUs, small footprint must be more important than an extensive feature set.
      But standard compliance is more important than small footprint.
      Surely a smaller RTOS could be produced by ignoring standards.
      Think of NuttX is a tiny Linux work-alike with a much reduced feature set.
      (2) There is no MMU-based support for processes.
      At present, NuttX assumes a flat address space.

      Fully scalable from tiny (8-bit) to moderate embedded (32-bit).

      Many tiny source files, link from static libraries, highly configurable, use of
      weak symbols when available.

    <p>
      NuttX strives to achieve a high degree of standards compliance.
      The primary governing standards are POSIX and ANSI standards.
      Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOS's are
      adopted for functionality not available under these standards
      or for functionality that is not appropriate for the deeply-embedded
      RTOS (such as <code>fork()</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this standards conformance, software developed under other
      standard OSs (such as Linux) should port easily to NuttX.

  <b>Look at all those files and features... How can it be a tiny OS?</b>.
  The NuttX feature list (above) is fairly long and if you look at the NuttX
  source tree, you will see that there are hundreds of source files comprising
  NuttX.  How can NuttX be a tiny OS with all of that?

    <p>
      The philosophy behind that NuttX is that lots of features are great... <i>BUT</i>
      also that if you don't use those features, then you should not have to pay a penalty
      for the unused features.
      And, with NuttX, you don't!  If you don't use a feature, it will not
      be included in the final executable binary.
      You only have to pay the penalty of increased footprint for the features
      that you actually use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a variety of technologies, NuttX can scale from the very tiny to
      the moderate-size system.  I have executed NuttX with some simple applications
      in as little as 32K <i>total</i> memory (code and data).
      On the other hand, typical, richly featured NuttX builds require more like 64K
      (and if all of the features are used, this can push 100K).

    <p>
      One may be intimidated by the size NuttX source tree.  There are hundreds of source files!
      How can that be a tiny OS?
      Actually, the large number of files is one of the tricks to keep NuttX small and
      as scalable as possible.
      Most files contain only a single function. 
      Sometimes just one tiny function with only a few lines of code.
      Why?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Static Libraries</b>.
        Because in the NuttX build processed, objects are compiled and saved into
        <i>static libraries</i> (<i>archives</i>).
        Then, when the file executable is linked, only the object files that are needed
        are extracted from the archive and added to the final executable.
        By having many, many tiny source files, you can assure that no code that you do
        not execute is ever included in the link.
        And by having many, tiny source files you have better granularity --
        if you don't use that tiny function of even just a few lines of code, it will
        not be included in the binary.

<tr>
  <td><br></td>
  <td>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, the use of many, tiny source files and linking from static
      libraries keeps the size of NuttX down.
      Other tricks used in NuttX include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
         <b>Configuration Files</b>.
         Before you build NuttX, you must provide a configuration file that specifies
         what features you plan to use and which features you do not.
         This configuration file contains a long list of settings that control
         what is built into NuttX and what is not.
         There are hundreds of such settings
         (see the <a href="NuttXPortingGuide.html#apndxconfigs">NuttX Porting Guide</a>
         for a partial list that excludes platform specific settings).
         These many, many configuration options allow NuttX to be highly tuned to
         meet size requirements.
         The downside to all of these configuration options is that it greatly
         complicates the maintenance of NuttX -- but that is my problem, not yours.
      </li>
      <li>
         <b>Weak Symbols</b>
         The GNU toolchain supports <i>weak</i> symbols and these also help to keep
         the size of NuttX down.
         Weak symbols prevent object files from being drawn into the link even if they
         are accessed from source code.
         Careful use of weak symbols is another trick for keep unused code out of the
         final binary.

    development board was first released in NuttX-5.1 with a GNU arm-nuttx-elf or arm-eabi toolchain* under Linux or Cygwin
    (but was not functional until NuttX-5.2).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p>
        <b>STATUS:</b>
          The basic EA3131 port is complete and verified in NuttX-5.2 
          This basic port includes basic boot-up, serial console, and timer interrupts.
          This port was extended in NuttX 5.3 with a USB high speed driver contributed by David Hewson.
          David also contributed I2C and SPI drivers plus several important LPC313x USB bug fixes
          that appear in the NuttX 5.6 release.
          This port has been verified using the NuttX OS test, USB serial and mass storage
          tests and includes a working implementation of the NuttShell (<a href="NuttShell.html">NSH</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
          Support for <a href="NuttXDemandPaging.html">on-demand paging</a> has been developed for the EA3131.
      That support would all execute of a program in SPI FLASH by paging code sections out of SPI flash as needed.
      However, as of this writing, I have not had the opportunity to verify this new feature.

          Verification of the port was deferred due to tool issues
          However, because of the high degree of compatibility between the LPC313x and LPC315x family, it
          is very likely that the support is in place (or at least very close).
          At this point, verification of the EA3152 port has been overcome by events and
          may never happen.
          However, the port is available for anyone who may want to use it.

          This includes verified support for:  SYSTICK system time,  pin and GPIO configuration, and a serial console.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several drivers have been copied from the related LPC17xx port but require integration into the LPC43xx:  ADC, DAC, GPDMA, I2C, SPI, and SSP.
          The registers for these blocks are the same in both the LPC43xx and the LPC17xx and they should integrate into the LPC43xx very easily by simply adapting the clocking and pin configuration logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other LPC17xx drivers were not brought into the LPC43xx port because these peripherals have been completely redesigned:  CAN, Ethernet, USB device, and USB host.
        </p>
        <p>
          So then there is no support for the following LPC43xx peripherals: SD/MMC, EMC, USB0,USB1, Ethernet, LCD, SCT, Timers 0-3, MCPWM, QEI, Alarm timer, WWDT, RTC, Event monitor, and CAN.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these can be leveraged from other MCUs that appear to support the same peripheral IP:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The LPC43xx USB0 peripheral appears to be the same as the USB OTG peripheral for the LPC31xx.
              The LPC31xx USB0 device-side driver has been copied from the LPC31xx port but also integration into the LPC43xx (clocking and pin configuration).
              It should be possible to complete poriting of this LPC31xx driver with a small porting effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Ethernet block looks to be based on the same IP as the STM32 Ethernet and, as a result, it should be possible to leverage the NuttX STM32 Ethernet driver with a little more effort.

    <p><b>AVR-Specific Issues</b>.
      The basic AVR port is solid and biggest issue for using AVR is its tiny SRAM memory and its Harvard architecture.
      Because of the Harvard architecture, constant data that resides to flash is inaccessible using &quot;normal&quot; memory reads and writes (only SRAM data can be accessed &quot;normally&quot;).
      Special AVR instructions are available for accessing data in FLASH, but these have not been integrated into the normal, general purpose OS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most NuttX test applications are console-oriented with lots of strings used for printf and debug output.
      These strings are all stored in SRAM now due to these data accessing issues and even the smallest console-oriented applications can quickly fill a 4-8K memory.
      So, in order for the AVR port to be useful, one of two things would need to be done:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Don't use console applications that required lots of strings.
        The basic AVR port is solid and your typical deeply embedded application should work fine.
        Or,
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a special version of printf that knows how to access strings that reside in FLASH (or EEPROM).

          Current Status: I think I have a hardware problem with my serial port setup.
          There is a good chance that the NSH port is complete and functional, but I am not yet able to demonstrate that.
          At present, I get nothing coming in the serial RXD line (probably because the pins are configured wrong or I have the MAX232 connected wrong).

      RGMP stands for RTOS and GPOS on Multi-Processor.
      RGMP is a project for  running GPOS and RTOS simultaneously on multi-processor platforms
      You can port your favorite RTOS to RGMP together with an unmodified Linux to form a hybrid operating system.
      This makes your application able to use both RTOS and GPOS features.

        (1) An OS test configuration and a (2) configuration that support the NuttShell (NSH).
        The OS test configuration is fully functional and proves that we have a basically healthy NuttX port to the Mirtoo.
        The NSH configuration includes support for a serial console and for the SST25 serial FLASH and the PGA117 amplifier/multiplexer on board the module.
        The NSH configuration is set up to use the NuttX wear-leveling FLASH file system (NXFFS).
        The PGA117, however, is not yet fully integrated to support ADC sampling.
        See the <a href="http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html">NSH User Guide</a> for further information about NSH.
        The first verified port to the Mirtoo module was available with the NuttX 6.20 release.

    <p>
      This is a tougher environment.
      In this case, the Windows native toolchain is unaware of the
      Cygwin <i>sandbox</i> and, instead, operates in the native Windows environment.
      The primary difficulties with this are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Paths</b>.
        Full paths for the native toolchain must follow Windows standards.
        For example, the path <code>/home/my\ name/nuttx/include</code> my have to be
        converted to something like <code>'C:\cygwin\home\my name\nuttx\include'</code>
        to be usable by the toolchain.
      </li>
      <p>
        Fortunately, this conversion is done simply using the <code>cygpath</code> utility.
      </p>
      <li>
        <b>Symbolic Links</b>
        NuttX depends on symbolic links to install platform-specific directories in the build system.
        On Linux, true symbolic links are used.
        On Cygwin, emulated symbolic links are used.
        Unfortunately, for native Windows applications that operate outside of the
        Cygwin <i>sandbox</i>, these symbolic links cannot be used.
      </li>
      <p>
        The NuttX make system works around this limitation by copying the platform
        specific directories in place.
        These copied directories make work a little more complex, but otherwise work well.
      </p>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: In this environment, it should be possible to use the NTFS <code>mklink</code> command to create links.
        This should only require a minor modification to the build scripts (see <code>tools/copydir.sh</code> script).
      </small></p>
      <li>
        <b>Dependencies</b>
        NuttX uses the GCC compiler's <code>-M</code> option to generate make dependencies.  These
        dependencies are retained in files called <code>Make.deps</code> throughout the system.
        For compilers other than GCC, there is no support for making dependencies in this way.
        For Windows native GCC compilers, the generated dependencies are windows paths and not
        directly usable in the Cygwin make.  By default, dependencies are surpressed for these
        compilers as well.
      </li>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: dependencies are suppress by setting the make variable <code>MKDEPS</code> to point
        to the do-nothing dependency script, <code>tools/mknulldeps.sh</code>.
      </small></p>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Supported Windows Native Toolchains</b>.
      At present, only the Zilog Z16F, z8Encore, and eZ80Acclaim ports use a non-GCC native Windows
      toolchain(the Zilog ZDS-II toolchain).
      Support for Windows native GCC toolchains (CodeSourcery and devkitARM) is currently implemented
      for the NXP LPC214x, STMicro STR71x, and Luminary LMS6918 ARM ports.
      (but could easily be extended to any other GCC-based platform with a small effort).

      I've never tried this one, but I off the following reported by an ez80 user using the ZiLOG ZDS-II Windows-native toolchain:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         &quot;I've installed ZDS-II 5.1.1 (IDE for ez80-based boards) on wine (windows emulator for UNIX) and to my surprise, not many changes were needed to make SVN snapshot of NuttX buildable...
         I've tried nsh profile and build process completed successfully.
         One remark is necessary: NuttX makefiles for ez80 are referencing <code>cygpath</code> utility.
         Wine provides similar thing called <code>winepath</code> which is compatible and offers compatible syntax.
         To use that, <code>winepath</code> (which itself is a shell script) has to be copied as <code>cygpath</code> somewhere in <code>$PATH</code>, and edited as in following patch:
       </p>
       <ul><pre>
# diff -u `which winepath` `which cygpath`

</pre></ul>
      <p>
        &quot;Better solution would be replacing all <code>cygpath</code> references in  <code>Makefiles </code> with  <code>$(CONVPATH)</code> (or  <code>${CONVPATH}</code> in shell scripts) and setting <code>CONVPATH</code> to  <code>cygpath</code> or  <code>winepath</code> regarding to currently used environment.

      <b>Environment Dependencies</b>.
      The primary environmental dependency of NuttX are (1) GNU make,
      (2) bash scripting, and (3) Linux utilities (such as cat, sed, etc.).
      If you have other platforms that support GNU make or make
      utilities that are compatible with GNU make, then it is very
      likely that NuttX would work in that environment as well (with some
      porting effort). If GNU make is not supported, then some significant
      modification of the Make system would be required.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>GNUWin32</b>.
      For example, with suitable make system changes, it should be possible to
      use native GNU tools (such as those from
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/">GNUWin32</a>)
      to build NuttX.
      However, that environment has not been used as of this writing.
   </p>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: One of the members on the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/nuttx/">NuttX forum</a>
        reported that they successful built NuttX using such a GNUWin32-based, Windows native environment.
        They reported that the only necessary change was to the use the NTFS mklink command to create links
        (see <code>tools/copydir.sh</code> script).

nuttx-6.23 2012-11-05 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_rng.c, chip/stm32_rng.h, and other files:
      Implementation of /dev/random using the STM32 Random Number
      Generator (RNG).
    * board.h file for shenzhou, fire-stm32v2, and olimex-stm32-p107:
      Add frequencies for HSE, HSI, LSE, and LSI.  These are needed
      by the STM32 watchdog driver.
    * CONFIG_EXAMPLES_*: To make things consistent, changed all occurrences
      of CONFIG_EXAMPLE_* to CONFIG_EXAMPLES_*.
    * drivers/mtd/w25.c and configs/*/src/up_w25.c:  Several fixes for the
      W25 SPI FLASH.
    * configs/*/Make.defs:  All buildroot tools now use the extension
      xxx-nuttx-elf- vs. xxx-elf-
    * configs/shenzhou/*/Make.defs:  Now uses the new buildroot 4.6.3
      EABI toolchain.
    * lib/stdio/lib_libdtoa.c:  Another dtoa() fix from Mike Smith.
    * configs/shenzhou/src/up_adc.c:  Add ADC support for the Shenzhou
      board (Darcy Gong).
    * configs/shenzhou/thttpd:  Add a THTTPD configuration for the
      Shenzhou board (Darcy Gong).
    * include/termios.h and lib/termios/libcf*speed.c: The non-standard,
      &quot;hidden&quot; c_speed cannot be type const or else static instantiations
      of termios will be required to initialize it (Mike Smith).
    * drivers/input/max11802.c/h, and include/nuttx/input max11802.h:  Adds
      support for the Maxim MAX11802 touchscreen controller (contributed by
      Petteri Aimonen).
    * graphics/nxtk/nxtk_events.c:  Missing implementatin of the blocked
      method.  This is a critical bugfix for graphics support (contributed
      by Petteri Aimonen).
    * drivers/usbdev/pl2303.c, drivers/usbdev/usbmsc.h, and
      include/nuttx/usb/cdcacm.h: USB_CONFIG_ATTR_SELFPOWER vs.
      USB_CONFIG_ATT_SELFPOWER (contributed by Petteri Aimonen).
    * arch/arm/src/armv7-m/up_memcpy.S:  An optimized memcpy() function for
      the ARMv7-M family contributed by Mike Smith.
    * lib/strings/lib_vikmemcpy.c:  As an option, the larger but faster
      implemementation of memcpy from Daniel Vik is now available (this is
      from http://www.danielvik.com/2010/02/fast-memcpy-in-c.html).
    * lib/strings/lib_memset.c: CONFIG_MEMSET_OPTSPEED will select a
      version of memset() optimized for speed.  By default, memset() is
      optimized for size.
    * lib/strings/lib_memset.c: CONFIG_MEMSET_64BIT will perform 64-bit
      aligned memset() operations.
    * arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_adc.c:  Need to put the ADC back into the
      initial reset in the open/setup logic.  Opening the ADC driver works
      the first time, but not the second because the device is left in a
      powered down state on the last close.
    * configs/olimex-lpc1766stck/scripts:  Replace all of the identical
      ld.script files with the common one in this directory.
    * configs/stm3220g-eval/scripts:  Replace all of the identical
      ld.script files with the common one in this directory.
    * configs/hymini-stm32v/scripts:  Replace all of the identical
      ld.script files with the common one in this directory.
    * configs/lpcxpresso-lpc1768/scripts:  Replace all of the identical
      ld.script files with the common one in this directory.
    * binfmt/elf.c, binfmt/libelf, include/elf.h, include/nuttx/elf.h: Add
      basic framework for loadable ELF module support.  The initial check-
      in is non-functional and is simply the framework for ELF support.
    * include/nuttx/binfmt.h, nxflat.h, elf.h, and symtab.h:  Moved to
      include/nuttx/binfmt/.
    * arch/sim/src/up_elf.c and arch/x86/src/common/up_elf.c:  Add
      for ELF modules.
    * arch/arm/include/elf.h:  Added ARM ELF header file.
    * include/elf32.h:  Renamed elf.h to elf32.h.
    * configs/stm32f4discovery/ostest:  Converted to use the new
      Kconfig-based configuration system.
    * configs/stm32f4discovery/elf and configs/stm32f4discovery/scripts/gnu-elf.ld
      Add a configuration for testing the ARM ELF loader.
    * binfmt/libelf:  Can't use fstat(). NuttX does not yet support it.  Damn!
    * binfmt/libelf:  The basic ELF module execution appears fully functional.
    * configs/shenzhou/src/up_relays.c:  Add support for relays from the
      Shenzhou board.  Contributed by Darcy Gong.
    * lib/fixedmath: Moved the old lib/math to lib/fixedmath to make room for
      the math library from the Rhombus OS
    * lib/math: Now contains the math library from the Rhombus OS by Nick Johnson
      (submitted by Darcy Gong).
    * include/float.h:  Add a first cut at the float.h header file.  This
      really should be an architecture/toolchain-specific header file.  It
      is only used if CONFIG_ARCH_FLOAT_H is defined.
    * lib/math: Files now conform to coding standards.  Separated float,
      double, and long double versions of code into separate files so that
      they don't draw in so much un-necessary code when doing a dumb link.
    * binfmt/libelf:  The ELF loader is working correctly with C++ static
      constructors and destructors and all.
    * Documentation/NuttXBinfmt.html:  Add documentionof the binary loader.
    * configs/sim/ostest:  Converted to use the mconfig configuration tool.
    * configs/sim/cxxtest:  New test that will be used to verify the uClibc++
      port (eventually).
    * include/nuttx/fs/fs.h, lib/stdio/lib_libfread.c, lib_ferror.c,
      lib_feof.c, and lib_clearerr.c:  Add support for ferror(), feof(),
      and clearerror().  ferror() support is bogus at the moment (it
      is equivalent to !feof()); the others should be good.
    * configs/stm32f4discovery/include/board.h:  Correct timer 2-7
      base frequency (provided by Freddie Chopin).
    * include/nuttx/sched.h, sched/atexit.c, and sched/task_deletehook.c:
      If both atexit() and on_exit() are enabled, then implement atexit()
      as just a special caseof on_exit().  This assumes that the ABI can
      handle receipt of more call parameters than the receiving function
      expects.  That is usually the case if parameters are passed in
      registers.
    * libxx/libxx_cxa_atexit():  Implements __cxa_atexit()
    * configs/stm32f4discovery/cxxtest:  New test that will be used to
      verify the uClibc++ port (eventually).  The sim platform turned not
      to be a good platform for testing uClibc++.  The sim example will not
      run because the simulator will attempt to execute the static
      constructors before main() starts. BUT... NuttX is not initialized
      and this results in a crash.  On the STM324Discovery, I will have
      better control over when the static constructors run.
    * RGMP 4.0 updated from Qiany Yu.
    * configs/*/Make.defs and configs/*/ld.script:  Massive clean-up
      and standardization of linker scripts from Freddie Chopin.
    * net/netdev_ioctl.c:  Add interface state flags and ioctl calls
      to bring network interfaces up and down (from Darcy Gong).
    * config/stm32f4discovery: Enable C++ exceptions.  Now the entire
      apps/examples/cxxtest works -- meaning the the uClibc++ is
      complete and verified for the STM32 platform.

apps-6.23 2012-11-05 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * vsn: Moved all NSH commands from vsn/ to system/.  Deleted the vsn/
      directory.
    * Makefile:  Change order of includes when CONFIG_NEWCONFIG=y.  In
      that case, namedapp must be included first so that the namedapp
      context is established first.  If the namedapp context is established
      later, it will overwrite any existing namedapp_list.h and nameapp_proto.h
      files.
    * CONFIG_EXAMPLES_*: To make things consistent, changed all occurrences
      of CONFIG_EXAMPLE_* to CONFIG_EXAMPLES_*.
    * Kconfig:  Fleshed out apps/examples/adc/Kconfig and apps/examples/wget/Kconfig.
      There are still a LOT of empty, stub Kconfig files.
    * Kconfig:  Fleshed out apps/examples/buttons/Kconfig. There are still a LOT
      of empty, stub Kconfig files.
    * apps/netutils/webserver/httpd.c:  Fix a bug that I introduced in
      recent check-ins (Darcy Gong).
    * apps/netutils/webclient/webclient.c:  Fix another but that I introduced
      when I was trying to add correct handling for loss of connection (Darcy Gong)
    * apps/nshlib/nsh_telnetd.c:  Add support for login to Telnet session via
      username and password (Darcy Gong).
    * apps/netutils/resolv/resolv.c (and files using the DNS resolver): Various
      DNS address resolution improvements from Darcy Gong.
    * apps/nshlib/nsh_netcmds.c:  The ping command now passes a maximum round
      trip time to uip_icmpping().  This allows pinging of hosts on complex
      networks where the ICMP ECHO round trip time may exceed the ping interval.
    * apps/examples/nxtext/nxtext_main.c:  Fix bad conditional compilation
      when CONFIG_NX_KBD is not defined.  Submitted by Petteri Aimonen.
    * apps/examples/nximage/nximage_main.c:  Add a 5 second delay after the
      NX logo is presented so that there is time for the image to be verified.
      Suggested by Petteri Aimonen.
    * apps/Makefile: Small change that reduces the number of shell invocations
      by one (Mike Smith).
    * apps/examples/elf:  Test example for the ELF loader.
    * apps/examples/elf:  The ELF module test example appears fully functional.
    * apps/netutils/json:  Add a snapshot of the cJSON project.  Contributed by
      Darcy Gong.
    * apps/examples/json:  Test example for cJSON from Darcy Gong
    * apps/nshlib/nsh_netinit.c: Fix static IP DNS problem (Darcy Gong)
    * apps/netutils/resolv/resolv.c: DNS fixes from Darcy Gong.
    * COPYING: Licensing information added.
    * apps/netutils/codec and include/netutils/urldecode.h, base64.h, and md5.h:
      A port of the BASE46, MD5 and URL CODEC library from Darcy Gong.
    * nsnlib/nsh_codeccmd.c:  NSH commands to use the CODEC library.
      Contributed by Darcy Gong.
    * apps/examples/wgetjson: Test example contributed by Darcy Gong
    * apps/examples/cxxtest:  A test for the uClibc++ library provided by
      Qiang Yu and the RGMP team.
    * apps/netutils/webclient, apps/netutils.codes, and apps/examples/wgetjson:
      Add support for wget POST interface.  Contributed by Darcy Gong.
    * apps/examples/relays:  A relay example contributed by Darcy Gong.
    * apps/nshlib/nsh_netcmds: Add ifup and ifdown commands (from Darcy
      Gong).
    * apps/nshlib/nsh_netcmds: Extend the ifconfig command so that it
      supports setting IP addresses, network masks, name server addresses,
      and hardware address (from Darcy Gong).

NxWidgets-1.3 2012-09-29 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * UnitTests/*/main.cxx:  Change entry point name to be consistent
      with with entry point naming conventions introduced in NuttX
      6.22.
    * Kconfig:  Added a mconfig configuration file.  Eventually, NxWidgets
      needs to get hooked into the NuttX mconf configuration.  Still not
      exactly sure how to do that.
    * libnxwidgets/Makefile and NxWidgets/nxwm/Makefile:  Need updates
      for consistency with recent changes to NuttX build system (&gt;= 6.22)
    * Kconfig:  Add option to turn on the memory monitor feature of the
      NxWidgets/NxWM unit tests.

uClibc++-1.0 2011-11-05 &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * The initial release of the uClibc++ implementation of the standard
      C++ library for NuttX.  This package was contributed ay Qiang Yu and
      David for the RGMP team.

buildroot-1.11 2011-11-05 &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * configs/avr-defconfig-4.3.3 - Added --enable-long-long as a GCC
      option.
    * configs/avr-defconfig-4.5.2 - New configuration.
    * Config.in and almost all configurations in configs/ - Changed the
      default nuttx path to $(TOPDIR)/../../nuttx
    * Misc files.  Patch provided by Gerd v. Egidy that solves the following
      problems
      - binutils 2.21 is not available on the gnu servers anymore, they replaced
        it with 2.21.1
      - there is some assembler error when compiling gcc for arm, gcc bugzilla
        43999
      - you can't build nuttx for cortex m3/m4 because of a missing instruction
        in the assembler, binutils bugzilla 12296
    * Add support for binutils 2.22 and GCC 4.6.3.
    * Change name of all tools from xxx-elf to xxx-nuttx-elf
    * Added an ARM EABI GCC 4.6.3 configuration (tool name is arm-nuttx-eabi-).
    * ldnxflat: Add support for the R_ARM_REL32 relocation.  This relocation
      type was not generated by GCC/LD prior to gcc-4.6.3
    * R_ARM_REL32 logic is conditionally disabled because it has not been
      tested.
    * ldnxflat: Correct a memory allocation error that could cause written
      past the end of allocated memory.  Partial restoration of R_ARM_REL32
      logic.  There are lots of issues that I still do not understand here.

pascal-3.0 2011-05-15 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * nuttx/:  The Pascal add-on module now installs and builds under the
      apps/interpreters directory.  This means that the pascal-2.1 module is
      incompatible with will all releases of NuttX prior to nuttx-6.0 where the 
      apps/ module was introduced.
