  NuttX is a real timed embedded operating system (RTOS).

  <td>
    <p>
      The goal is to provide implementations of most standard POSIX OS interfaces
      to support a rich, multi-threaded development environment for deeply embedded
      processors.
    </p>
      NON-GOALS: (1) It is not a goal to provide the level of OS features like those provided by Linux.
      In order to work with smaller MCUs, small footprint must be more important than an extensive feature set.
      But standard compliance is more important than small footprint.
      Surely a smaller RTOS could be produced by ignoring standards.
      Think of NuttX is a tiny Linux work-alike with a much reduced feature set.
      (2) There is no MMU-based support for processes.
      At present, NuttX assumes a flat address space.

    <p>
      Fully scalable from tiny (8-bit) to moderate embedded (32-bit).
      Scalability with rich feature set is accomplished with:
      Many tiny source files, link from static libraries, highly configurable, use of
      weak symbols when available.

    <p>
      NuttX strives to achieve a high degree of standards compliance.
      The primary governing standards are POSIX and ANSI standards.
      Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOS's are
      adopted for functionality not available under these standards
      or for functionality that is not appropriate for the deeply-embedded
      RTOS (such as <code>fork()</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this standards conformance, software developed under other
      standard OSs (such as Linux) should port easily to NuttX.

  <b>Look at all those files and features... How can it be a tiny OS?</b>.
  The NuttX feature list (above) is fairly long and if you look at the NuttX
  source tree, you will see that there are hundreds of source files comprising
  NuttX.  How can NuttX be a tiny OS with all of that?

      The philosophy behind that NuttX is that lots of features are great... <i>BUT</i>
      also that if you don't use those features, then you should not have to pay a penalty
      for the unused features.
      And, with NuttX, you don't!  If you don't use a feature, it will not
      be included in the final executable binary.
      You only have to pay the penalty of increased footprint for the features
      that you actually use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a variety of technologies, NuttX can scale from the very tiny to
      the moderate-size system.  I have executed NuttX with some simple applications
      in as little as 32K <i>total</i> memory (code and data).
      On the other hand, typical, richly featured NuttX builds require more like 64K
      (and if all of the features are used, this can push 100K).

    <p>
      One may be intimidated by the size NuttX source tree.  There are hundreds of source files!
      How can that be a tiny OS?
      Actually, the large number of files is one of the tricks to keep NuttX small and
      as scalable as possible.
      Most files contain only a single function. 
      Sometimes just one tiny function with only a few lines of code.
      Why?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Static Libraries</b>.
        Because in the NuttX build processed, objects are compiled and saved into
        <i>static libraries</i> (<i>archives</i>).
        Then, when the file executable is linked, only the object files that are needed
        are extracted from the archive and added to the final executable.
        By having many, many tiny source files, you can assure that no code that you do
        not execute is ever included in the link.
        And by having many, tiny source files you have better granularity --
        if you don't use that tiny function of even just a few lines of code, it will
        not be included in the binary.

    <b>Other Tricks</b>

<tr>
  <td><br></td>
  <td>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, the use of many, tiny source files and linking from static
      libraries keeps the size of NuttX down.
      Other tricks used in NuttX include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
         <b>Configuration Files</b>.
         Before you build NuttX, you must provide a configuration file that specifies
         what features you plan to use and which features you do not.
         This configuration file contains a long list of settings that control
         what is built into NuttX and what is not.
         There are hundreds of such settings
         (see the <a href="NuttxPortingGuide.html#apndxconfigs">NuttX Porting Guide</a>
         for a partial list that excludes platform specific settings).
         These many, many configuration options allow NuttX to be highly tuned to
         meet size requirements.
         The downside to all of these configuration options is that it greatly
         complicates the maintenance of NuttX -- but that is my problem, not yours.
      </li>
      <li>
         <b>Weak Symbols</b>
         The GNU toolchain supports <i>weak</i> symbols and these also help to keep
         the size of NuttX down.
         Weak symbols prevent object files from being drawn into the link even if they
         are accessed from source code.
         Careful use of weak symbols is another trick for keep unused code out of the
         final binary.

<p>
  <b>Additional new features and extended functionality</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>OS Initialization</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Removed support for <code>CONFIG_BUILTIN_APP_START</code>. 
        This is not really a useful feature and creates a violation of the OS layered architecture.
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Task Creation</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Implement a simple <code>vfork()</code>).
        In NuttX-6.25, this interface is available only for ARM7/9, ARMv7-M (Cortext-M3/4), and MIPS32 (PIC32MX) platforms.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>exec()</code> now sets the priority of the new task to the same priority as the parent task (instead of the arbirtrary value of 50).
      </li>
      <li>
        New, partially complient implementations of <code>execv()</code> and <code>execl()</code>.
        These are only partially compliant because they do not overlay any existing &quot;process space&quot; but rather create the new task and <code>exit()</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a complete implementation of <code>posix_spawn()</code>.
        This standard interface is a better match for an MMU-less architecture than are <code>vfork()</code>) plus <code>execv()</code> or <code>execl()</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a task start hook that will be called before the task main executes.
        This can be used, for example, to schedule C++ static constructors to run automatically in the context of the new task.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Task Parentage</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Repartitioned tasking data structures.
        All shared resources are now collected together in a &quot;task group&quot;. 
        A &quot;task group&quot; includes the resource for the original task that are shared with all of the <code>pthreads</code> created by the task.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for remember the parent &quot;task group&quot; when a new task is started.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added optional support to record the membership of each thread in the &quot;task group&quot;.
      </li>
      <li>
        Implement support for retaining child task status in the &quot;task group&quot; after the child task exists.
        This is behavior required by POSIX.
        But in NuttX is only enabled with <code>CONFIG_SCHED_HAVE_PARENT</code> and <code>CONFIG_SCHED_CHILD_STATUS</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add internal logic to &quot;reparent&quot; a task.
        This is useful, for example, where the child task is created through a trampoline task that redirects I/O.
        Reparenting allows the caller of <code>posix_spawn()</code> to be reparented for the eventual child thread.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for <code>SIGCHLD</code>.
        Sent to all members of the parent &quot;task group&quot; when the finall member of the child task group exits.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <code>SIGCHLD</code> and retention of child task exist status are enabled, then a more spec-compliant version of <code>waitpid()</code> is enabled.
      </li>
      <li>
        New interfaces <code>waitid()</code> and <code>wait()</code> are also enabled when <code>SIGCHLD</code> is enabled.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>File System</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>dup()</code> and <code>dup2()</code> can new be used with opened files in a mounted file system.
        This supports re-direction of output in NSH to files.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code>binfs</code> file system was moved from <code>apps/builtin</code> to <code>fs/binfs</code>.
        The <code>binfs</code> file system was extended to support execution of &quot;builtin applications&quot; using <code>exec()</code>, <code>execv()</code>, <code>execl()</code>, or <code>posix_spawn()</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added logic based on <code>SIGCHLD</code> to automatically unload and clean-up after running a task that was loaded into memory.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Binary Formats</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Much of the logic for &quot;builtin applications&quot; was moved from <code>apps/builtin</code> to <code>nuttx/binfmt/libbuiltin</code>.
        Includes some extensions contributed by Mike Smith.
      </li>
      <li>
        A binary loader was added for builtin applications to support execution of &quot;builtin applications&quot; using <code>exec()</code>, <code>execv()</code>, <code>execl()</code>, or <code>posix_spawn()</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Drivers</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added logic to marshal and serialized &quot;out-of-band&quot; keyboard commands (such as cursor controls and key release events) intermixed with normal ASCII keypress data.
        The encoding is partially integrated in the HID keyboard driver and the decoding is fully integrated into the <code>apps/examples</code> <code>hidkbd/</code> and <code>keypadtest/</code> (the latter contributed by Denis Carlikli).
      </li>
      <li>
        Driver for the UG-2864HSWEG01 OLED contributed by Darcy Gong.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add support for removable serial devices (like USB serial).
        This support is enabled by <code>CONFIG_SERIAL_REMOVABLE</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>ARMv7-M</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added an option to use the <code>BASEPRI</code> register to disable interrupts (instead of the <code>PRIMASK</code> register).
        This eliminates some innocuous hardfaults that interfere with some debug tools.
        You need to switch to the <code>BASEPRI</code> method only if you have such tool interference.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>STM32 Drivers</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bring STM32 F1 DMA capabilities up to par with the STM32 F2/F4 (contributed by Mike Smith).

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>tools/kconfig.bat</code>:  Kludge to run kconfig-frontends from a DOS shell.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>tools/configure.c</code>:  <code>configure.c</code> can be used to build a work-alike program as a replacement for <code>configure.sh</code>.
        This work-alike program would be used in environments that do not support Bash scripting (such as the Windows native environment).
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>tools/configure.bat</code>: <code>configure.bat</code> is a small Windows batch file that can be used as a replacement for <code>configure.sh</code> in a Windows native environment.
        <code>configure.bat</code> is actually just a thin layer that executes <code>configure.exe</code> if it is available.
        If <code>configure.exe</code> is not available, then configure.bat will attempt to build it first (assumes the MinGW-GCC is available).

      <b>Applications</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        New and modified examples:
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>apps/examples/wlan</code>: Remove non-functional example.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>apps/examples/ostest</code>: Added a test of <code>vfork()</code>).
              Extend signal handler test to catch death-of-child signals (<code>SIGCHLD</code>).
              Add a test for <code>waitpid()</code>, <code>waitid()</code>, and <code>wait()</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>apps/exampes/posix_spawn</code>: Added a test of <code>posix_spawn()</code>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <p>
      </li>
      <li>
        NSH:
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              NSH now supports re-direction of I/O to files (but still not from).
            </li>
            <li>
              The block driver source argument to the mount command is now optional for file systems that do not require a block driver.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        NSH can now execute a program from a file system using <code>posix_spawn()</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for a login script.
        The <code>init.d/rcS</code> script will be executed once when NSH starts;
        the <code>.nshrc</code> script will be executed for each session:
        Once for a serial console, once for each USB connection, and once for each Telnet session.
      </li>
      <li>
        Supports a new daemon that can be used to monitor USB trace outpout.
      </li>
      <li>
        Removed non-functional <code>wlan</code> example.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Bugfixes</b> (see the change log for details).
  Some of these are very important:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Tasking</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fixed a *critical* task exit bug.
        Here is the failure scenario:
        (1) <code>sched_lock()</code> is called increments the lockcount on the current TCB (i.e., the one at the head of the ready to run list),
        (2) <code>sched_mergepending()</code> is called which may change the task at the head of the ready-to-run list, then
        (3) <code>sched_unlock()</code> is called which decrements the lockcount on the wrong TCB.
        The failure case that I saw was that pre-emption got disabled in the IDLE thread, locking up the whole system.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Signals</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>sigtimedwait()</code> would return a bad signal number if the signal was already pending when the function was called.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Drivers</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Some SD cards will appear busy until switched to SPI mode for first time.
        Having a pull-up resistor on MISO may avoid this problem, but this fix from Petteri Aimonen makes it work also without pull-up.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>STM32 Drivers</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        STM32 FLASH driver counting error (from Freddie Chopin).
      </li>
      <li>
        STM32 F4 maximum SPI frequency was wrong (corrected by Petteri Aimonen).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>STM32 Boards</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Due to cloning of untested code, the logic to control on-board LEDs did not work on any STM32 boards.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serial devices number <code>/dev/ttyS0-5</code> is there is a serial console, but <code>/dev/ttyS1-6</code> if there is no serial console.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Binary Formats</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        C++ static constructors execute now using a start taskhook so that they execute in the context of the child task (instead of in the context of the parent task).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>File Systems</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Several FAT-related bugs fixed by Petteri Aimonen.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Networking</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fix poll/select issure reported by Qiang: <code>poll_interrupt()</code> must call <code>net_lostconnection()</code> when a loss of connection is reported.
        Otherwise, the system will not remember that the connection has been lost and will hang waiting on a unconnected socket later.
      </li>
      <li>
        Similar issues corrected for <code>recvfrom()</code> and <code>send()</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Telnetd would hang in a loop if <code>recv()</code> ever returned a value &lt;= 0.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Libraries</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>fread()</code> could hang on certain error conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can't handle <code>SYSLOG</code> output to a character device from the IDLE task (because the IDLE task can't block). 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Build System</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      Serial was driver was not being built if there is no console device.
      Obviously, the serial driver may be needed even in this case.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Additional Bugfixes</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>sig_timedwait()</code> and <code>clock_time2ticks.c</code>:  Timing &quot;rounding&quot; logic
      </li>
      <li>
        ARM9 Compilation issue with low vectors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>readline()</code> return value
      </li>
      <li>
        As well as other, less critical bugs as detailed in the ChangeLog: HID keyboard, LPC17xx bit definitions, strndup(), PL2303, SYSLOG error handling, AT25, <code>apps/examples</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>

          Basic support is in place for both the LPC3152 MCU and the EA3152 board.
          Verification of the port was deferred due to tool issues
          However, because of the high degree of compatibility between the LPC313x and LPC315x family, it
          is very likely that the support is in place (or at least very close).
          At this point, verification of the EA3152 port has been overcome by events and
          may never happen.
          However, the port is available for anyone who may want to use it.

          This includes verified support for:  SYSTICK system time,  pin and GPIO configuration, and a serial console.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several drivers have been copied from the related LPC17xx port but require integration into the LPC43xx:  ADC, DAC, GPDMA, I2C, SPI, and SSP.
          The registers for these blocks are the same in both the LPC43xx and the LPC17xx and they should integrate into the LPC43xx very easily by simply adapting the clocking and pin configuration logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other LPC17xx drivers were not brought into the LPC43xx port because these peripherals have been completely redesigned:  CAN, Ethernet, USB device, and USB host.
        </p>
        <p>
          So then there is no support for the following LPC43xx peripherals: SD/MMC, EMC, USB0,USB1, Ethernet, LCD, SCT, Timers 0-3, MCPWM, QEI, Alarm timer, WWDT, RTC, Event monitor, and CAN.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these can be leveraged from other MCUs that appear to support the same peripheral IP:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The LPC43xx USB0 peripheral appears to be the same as the USB OTG peripheral for the LPC31xx.
              The LPC31xx USB0 device-side driver has been copied from the LPC31xx port but also integration into the LPC43xx (clocking and pin configuration).
              It should be possible to complete poriting of this LPC31xx driver with a small porting effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Ethernet block looks to be based on the same IP as the STM32 Ethernet and, as a result, it should be possible to leverage the NuttX STM32 Ethernet driver with a little more effort.

    <p><b>AVR-Specific Issues</b>.
      The basic AVR port is solid and biggest issue for using AVR is its tiny SRAM memory and its Harvard architecture.
      Because of the Harvard architecture, constant data that resides to flash is inaccessible using &quot;normal&quot; memory reads and writes (only SRAM data can be accessed &quot;normally&quot;).
      Special AVR instructions are available for accessing data in FLASH, but these have not been integrated into the normal, general purpose OS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most NuttX test applications are console-oriented with lots of strings used for printf and debug output.
      These strings are all stored in SRAM now due to these data accessing issues and even the smallest console-oriented applications can quickly fill a 4-8K memory.
      So, in order for the AVR port to be useful, one of two things would need to be done:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Don't use console applications that required lots of strings.
        The basic AVR port is solid and your typical deeply embedded application should work fine.
        Or,
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a special version of printf that knows how to access strings that reside in FLASH (or EEPROM).

          Current Status: I think I have a hardware problem with my serial port setup.
          There is a good chance that the NSH port is complete and functional, but I am not yet able to demonstrate that.
          At present, I get nothing coming in the serial RXD line (probably because the pins are configured wrong or I have the MAX232 connected wrong).

        The NSH configuration includes support for a serial console and for the SST25 serial FLASH and the PGA117 amplifier/multiplexer on board the module.
        The NSH configuration is set up to use the NuttX wear-leveling FLASH file system (NXFFS).
        The PGA117, however, is not yet fully integrated to support ADC sampling.
        See the <a href="http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html">NSH User Guide</a> for further information about NSH.
        The first verified port to the Mirtoo module was available with the NuttX 6.20 release.

   <p><b>PIC32MX460F512L</b>.  There one two board ports using this chip:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><b>PIC32MX Board from PCB Logic Design Co</b>.
      This port is for the PIC32MX board from PCB Logic Design Co. and used the PIC32MX460F512L.
      The board is a very simple -- little more than a carrier for the PIC32 MCU plus voltage regulation, debug interface, and an OTG connector.
    </li>
    <p>
      <b>STATUS:</b>
      The basic port is code complete and fully verified in NuttX 6.13.
      Available configurations include the OS test and the NuttShell (NSH - see the <a href="http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html">NSH User Guide</a>).
    </p>
    <li><b>UBW32 Board from Sparkfun</b>
      This is the port to the Sparkfun UBW32 board.
      This port uses the <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8971">original v2.5</a> board which is based on the MicroChip PIC32MX460F512L.
      This older version has been replaced with this <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9713">newer board</a>.
      See also the <a href="http://www.schmalzhaus.com/UBW32/">UBW32</a> web site.
    </li>
    <p>
      <b>STATUS:</b>
      The basic port is code complete and fully verified in NuttX 6.18.
      Available configurations include the OS test and the NuttShell (NSH - see the <a href="http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html">NSH User Guide</a>).
      USB has not yet been fully tested but on first pass appears to be functional.

        This board features the MicroChip PIC32MX440F512H.
        See the <a href="http://www.sureelectronics.net/goods.php?id=1168">Sure website</a> for further information about the DB-DP11215 board.
        (I believe that that the DB-DP11215 may be obsoleted now but replaced with the very similar, DB-DP11212.
        The DB-DP11212 board differs, I believe, only in its serial port configuration.)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p>
       <b>STATUS:</b>
       This NuttX port is code complete and has considerable test testing.
       The port for this board was completed in NuttX 6.11, but still required a few bug fixes before it will be ready for prime time.
       The fully verified port first appeared in NuttX 6.13.
       Available configurations include the OS test and the NuttShell (NSH - see the <a href="http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html">NSH User Guide</a>).
       An untested USB device-side driver is available in the source tree.
       A more complete port would include support of the USB OTG port and of the LCD display on this board.
       Those drivers are not yet available as of this writing.

      </li>
      <p>
       <b>STATUS:</b>
         This port was started and then shelved for some time until I received the Expansion I/O board.
         The basic Starter Kit (even with the Multimedia Expansion Board, MEB, DM320005)) has no serial port and most NuttX test configurations depend heavily on console output.
      </p>
      <p>
         Verified configurations for the OS test and the NuttShel (NSH) appeared in NuttX-6.16.
         Board support includes a verified USB (device-side) driver.
         Also included are a a verified Ethernet driver, a partially verified USB device controller driver, and an unverifed SPI driver.

        A port has been completed for the  Mikroelektronika PIC32MX7 Multimedia Board (MMB).
        See http://www.mikroe.com/ for further information about this board.
      </li>
      <p>
       <b>STATUS:</b>

         (1) The basic OS test configuration that verfies the correctness port of NuttX, and (2) an extensive <a href="NuttShell.html">NuttShell (NSH)</a> configuration.
         The NSH configuration includes:
         (1) Full network support,
         (2) Verified SPI driver,
         (3) SPI-based SD Card support,
         (4) USB device support (including configuration options for the USB mass storage device and the CDC/ACM serial class), and
         (5) Support for the MIO873QT2 LCD on the PIC32MX7 MMB.
       </p>
       </p>
         The PIC32MX7 MMB's touchscreen is connected directly to the MCU via ADC pins.
         A touchscreen driver has been developed using the PIC32's ADC capabilities and can be enabled in the NSH configuration.
         However, additional verification and tuning of this driver is required.
         Further display/touchscreen verification would require C++ support (for NxWidgets and NxWM).
         Since I there is no PIC32 C++ is the free version of the MPLAB C32 toolchain, further graphics development is stalled.

        that certain SH-1 instructions stop working as advertised.  This could be a silicon
        problem, some pipeline issue that is not handled properly by the gcc 3.4.5 toolchain
        (which has very limit SH-1 support to begin with), or perhaps with the CMON debugger.

    <p>
      This is a tougher environment.
      In this case, the Windows native toolchain is unaware of the
      Cygwin <i>sandbox</i> and, instead, operates in the native Windows environment.
      The primary difficulties with this are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Paths</b>.
        Full paths for the native toolchain must follow Windows standards.
        For example, the path <code>/home/my\ name/nuttx/include</code> my have to be
        converted to something like <code>'C:\cygwin\home\my name\nuttx\include'</code>
        to be usable by the toolchain.
      </li>
      <p>
        Fortunately, this conversion is done simply using the <code>cygpath</code> utility.
      </p>
      <li>
        <b>Symbolic Links</b>
        NuttX depends on symbolic links to install platform-specific directories in the build system.
        On Linux, true symbolic links are used.
        On Cygwin, emulated symbolic links are used.
        Unfortunately, for native Windows applications that operate outside of the
        Cygwin <i>sandbox</i>, these symbolic links cannot be used.
      </li>
      <p>
        The NuttX make system works around this limitation by copying the platform
        specific directories in place.
        These copied directories make work a little more complex, but otherwise work well.
      </p>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: In this environment, it should be possible to use the NTFS <code>mklink</code> command to create links.
        This should only require a minor modification to the build scripts (see <code>tools/copydir.sh</code> script).
      </small></p>
      <li>
        <b>Dependencies</b>
        NuttX uses the GCC compiler's <code>-M</code> option to generate make dependencies.  These
        dependencies are retained in files called <code>Make.deps</code> throughout the system.
        For compilers other than GCC, there is no support for making dependencies in this way.
        For Windows native GCC compilers, the generated dependencies are windows paths and not
        directly usable in the Cygwin make.  By default, dependencies are surpressed for these
        compilers as well.
      </li>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: dependencies are suppress by setting the make variable <code>MKDEPS</code> to point
        to the do-nothing dependency script, <code>tools/mknulldeps.sh</code>.
      </small></p>

      Build support has been added to support building natively in a Windows console rather than in a POSIX-like environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This build:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Uses all Windows style paths</li>
      <li>Uses primarily Windows batch commands from cmd.exe, with</li>
      <li>A few extensions from GNUWin32</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This capability first appeared in NuttX-6.24 and should still be considered a work in progress because: (1) it has not been verfied on all targets and tools, and (2) still lacks some of the creature-comforts of the more mature environments.
      The windows native build logic initiatiated if <code>CONFIG_WINDOWS_NATIVE=y</code> is defined in the NuttX configuration file:

      At present, this build environment also requires:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Windows Console</b>.
        The build must be performed in a Windows console window.
        This may be using the standard <code>CMD.exe</code> terminal that comes with Windows.
        I prefer the ConEmu terminal which can be downloaded from:
        http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>GNUWin32</b>.
        The build still relies on some Unix-like commands.
        I usethe GNUWin32 tools that can be downloaded from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/.
        See the top-level <code>nuttx/README.txt</code> file for some download, build, and installation notes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>MinGW-GCC</b>.
        MinGW-GCC is used to compiler the C tools in the <code>nuttx/tools</code> directory that are neede by the build.
        MinGW-GCC can be downloaded from http://www.mingw.org/.
        If you are using GNUWin32, then it is recommendedthe you not install the optional MSYS components as there may be conflicts.

      I've never tried this one, but I off the following reported by an ez80 user using the ZiLOG ZDS-II Windows-native toolchain:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         &quot;I've installed ZDS-II 5.1.1 (IDE for ez80-based boards) on wine (windows emulator for UNIX) and to my surprise, not many changes were needed to make SVN snapshot of NuttX buildable...
         I've tried nsh profile and build process completed successfully.
         One remark is necessary: NuttX makefiles for ez80 are referencing <code>cygpath</code> utility.
         Wine provides similar thing called <code>winepath</code> which is compatible and offers compatible syntax.
         To use that, <code>winepath</code> (which itself is a shell script) has to be copied as <code>cygpath</code> somewhere in <code>$PATH</code>, and edited as in following patch:
       </p>
       <ul><pre>
# diff -u `which winepath` `which cygpath`
--- /usr/bin/winepath 2011-05-02 16:00:40.000000000 +0200

#

# determine the app Winelib library name
-appname=`basename "$0" .exe`.exe
+appname=winepath.exe

# first try explicit WINELOADER
if [ -x "$WINELOADER" ]; then exec "$WINELOADER" "$appname" "$@"; fi
</pre></ul>
      <p>
        &quot;Better solution would be replacing all <code>cygpath</code> references in  <code>Makefiles </code> with  <code>$(CONVPATH)</code> (or  <code>${CONVPATH}</code> in shell scripts) and setting <code>CONVPATH</code> to  <code>cygpath</code> or  <code>winepath</code> regarding to currently used environment.

    <p>
      <b>Environment Dependencies</b>.
      The primary environmental dependency of NuttX are (1) GNU make,
      (2) bash scripting, and (3) Linux utilities (such as cat, sed, etc.).
      If you have other platforms that support GNU make or make
      utilities that are compatible with GNU make, then it is very
      likely that NuttX would work in that environment as well (with some
      porting effort). If GNU make is not supported, then some significant
      modification of the Make system would be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MSYS</b>.
      I have not used MSYS but what I gather from talking with NuttX users is that MSYS can be used as an alternative to Cygwin in any of the above Cygwin environments.
      This is not surprising since MSYS is based on an older version of Cygwin (cygwin-1.3).
      MSYS has been modified, however, to interoperate in the Windows environment better than Cygwin and that may be of value to some users.
    </p>
    <p>
      MSYS, however, cannot be used with the native Windows NuttX build because it will invoke the MSYS bash shell instead of the <code>CMD.exe</code> shell.
      Use GNUWin32 in the native Windows build envionment.

nuttx-6.25 2013-02-01 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * graphics/: Adds 5x8 monospace font. This tiny font is useful for graph
      labels and for small bitmapped display.  Contributed by Petteri
      Aimonen.
    * configs/stm3220g-eval/nxwm:  Converted to use the kconfig-frontends
      configuration tool.
    * configs/sim/nxwm:  Converted to use the kconfig-frontends configuration
      tool.
    * include/pthread.h:  In sys/prctl.h because it is needed by
      pthread_[set|get]name_np()
    * tools/kconfig.bat:  Kludge to run kconfig-frontends from a DOS shell.
    * sched/sig_timedwait.c:  Should always move the time up to the next
      largest number of system ticks.  The logic was rounding.  Noted by
      Petteri Aimonen.
    * arch/arm/src/up_head.S:  Fix backward conditional compilation.  NOTE
      there is a issue of ARM9 systems with low vectors and large memories
      that will have to be addressed in the future.
    * libc/misc/lib_kbdencode.c and lib_kbddecode.c:  Add logic to marshal
      and serialized &quot;out-of-band&quot; keyboard commands intermixed with normal
      ASCII data (not yet hooked into anything).
    * drivers/usbhost/usbhost_hidkbd.c:  If CONFIG_HIDKBD_ENCODED is
      defined, this driver will now use libc/misc/lib_kbdencode.c to
      encode special function keys.
    * configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/hidkbd:  This configuration has been
      converted to use the kconfig-frontends configuration tool.
    * drivers/lcd/ug-2864hsweg01.c and include/nuttx/lcd/ug-2864hsweg01.h:
      Driver for UG-2864HSWEG01 OLED contributed by Darcy Gong.
    * configs/stm32f4discovery/src/up_ug2864hsweg01.c: Support for the
      UG-2864HSWEG01 OLED for the STM32F4Discovery board.
    * drivers/usbhost/usbhost_hidkbd.c:  Correct a logic error in how
      tasks waiting for read data are awakened.
    * libc/misc/lib_kbdencode.c and lib_kbddecode.c:  Now handles keypress
      events too.  However, the USB HID keyboard driver has not yet been
      updated to detect key release events.  That is kind of tricky in
      the USB HID keyboard report data.
    * configs/mcu123-214x/nsh:  Converted to use the kconfig-frontends
      configuration tool.
    * configs/zp214xpa:  Add basic support for the The0.net ZP213x/4xPA
      board (with the LPC2148 and the UG_2864AMBAG01).
    * configs/sim/nxlines:  Add an nxlines configuration for the
      simulator.
    * configs/zp214xpa/nxlines:  Add an nxlines configuration for the
      ZP213x/4xPA (with the LPC2148 and the UG_2864AMBAG01).  Working
      as of 2012-12-30.
    * configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/wlan:  Remove non-functional
      configuration.
    * configs/stm32f4discovery/src and nuttx/drivers/lcd/ug-2864hsweg01.c:
      Updates and correctinos for the UG-2864HSWEG01 from Darcy Gong.
    * configs/lm326965-ek:  All configurations converted to use the
      kconfig-frontends configuration tool.
    * configs/Kconfig: NSH_MMCSDSPIPORTNO should depend on MMCSD_SPI,
      not just SPI (from Jose Pablo Carballo).
    * arch/arm/src/arm/Kconfig and armv7m/Kconfig:  Add an option for
      buildroot toolchains:  They may be EABI or OABI.
    * include/nuttx/progmem and arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_flash.c:
      Fix a counting bug plus change interface to use either relative
      or absolute FLASH addressing (from Freddie Chopin).
    * libc/misc/Make.defs:  Fix error in conditional for KBD CODEC.
    * libc/Kconfig and configs/*/defconfig (several):  The default
      setting should be CONFIG_LIB_KBDCODEC=n
    * tools/configure.c:  configure.c can be used to build a work-alike
      program as a replacement for configure.sh.  This work-alike
      program would be used in environments that do not support Bash
      scripting (such as the Windows native environment).
    * tools/configure.bat: configure.bat is a small Windows batch
      file that can be used as a replacement for configure.sh in a
      Windows native environment.  configure.bat is actually just a
      thin layer that executes configure.exe if it is available. If
      configure.exe is not available, then configure.bat will attempt
      to build it first.
    * arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_syscon.h:  Correct some typos in bit
      definitions (from Rommel Marcelo).
    * libc/string/lib_strndup.c: strndup() should use strnlen(), not
      strlen(), to determine the size of the string.
    * sched/os_bringup.c:  Remove support for CONFIG_BUILTIN_APP_START.
      This is not really a useful feature and creates a violation of the
      OS layered architecture.
    * include/unistd.h, arch/arch/src/*:  Implement a simple vfork().
      On initial checkin, this API is available only for ARM platforms.
    * binfmt/binfmt_exec.c: exec() now sets the priority of the new task
      to the same priority as the current task (instead of the arbirtrary
      value of 50).
    * libc/unisted/lib_execv.c and lib_execl.c:  New, somewhat flawed,
      implementations of execv() and execl().
    * tools/cfgdefine.c:  Strips quotes from CONFIG_EXECFUNCS_SYMTAB
      value.
    * arch/arm/include/lm3s/chip.h:  Move chip definitions into
      public include area for compatibility with other architectures.
    * arch/arm/src/lm3s/chip:  Move register definition header files
      into a new chip/ sub-directory.
    * arch/arm/src/lm3s/lm3s_internal.h:  Broke up into several
      smaller header files.
    * arch/arm/src/lm:  Rename the arch/arm/src/lm3s directory to
      arch/arm/src/lm so that is can support other members of the
      Stellaris family.
    * libc/spawn:  Add file action interfaces needed by posix_spawn().
    * sched/clock_time2ticks.c:  Another case where time was being
      rounded down instead of up (from Mike Smith).
    * libc/spawn:  Implementation of posix_spawn() is complete but
      untested and undocumented.
    * drivers/usbdev/pl2303.c:  Fix typols in the PL2303 driver
      (from Max Holtzberg).
    * configs/stm32f4discovery/posix_spawn:  Added a configuration
      that can be used for testing posix_spawn().
    * arch/arm/src/stm32: Bring F1 support for general DMA and serial
      DMA in paricular up to parity with F2/F4 (from Mike Smith).
    * libc/stdio/lib_libfread.c:  Correct some error handling when
      lib_fread() was passed a bad stream.  Needed to move the
      releasing of a semaphore inside of some conditional logic
      (cosmetic).
    * include/nuttx/sched.h, sched/task_setup.c, and sched/task_exithook.c:
      Add support for remembering the parent task and sending
      SIGCHLD to the parent when the task exists.
    * sched/task_exithook.c:  Fixed a *critical* bug.  Here is
      the scenario: (1) sched_lock() is called increments the lockcount
      on the current TCB (i.e., the one at the head of the ready to run
      list), (2) sched_mergepending is called which may change the task
      at the head of the ready-to-run list, then (3) sched_unlock() is called
      which decrements the lockcount on the wrong TCB.  The failure case
      that I saw was that pre-emption got disabled in the IDLE thread,
      locking up the whole system.
    * sched/sched_waitpid.c:  Use SIGCHLD instead of a semaphore.  This
      is a much more spec-compliant implementation.  However, there are
      some issues with overruning signals because NuttX does not support
      queueing of signals (POSIX does not require it).  I think it may
      need to.
    * sched/sched_waitid.c and sched_wait.c:  Add support for waitid()
      and wait().  See issues with waitpid() above.
    * include/nuttx/fs/fs.h and fs/fs_files.c:  Add a dup() method to
      the struct mountpt_operations.  When dup'ing a file that resides
      on a mounted volume, let the file system's dup() method do the
      work.
    * fs/romfs/fs_romfs.c: Implemented the dup() method for the ROMFS
      file system.
    * fs/fat/fs_fat32.c, fs/nxffs/nxffs_initialize, and
      fs/nfs/nfs_vfsops.c:  Add hooks for dup() method (not yet
      implemented).
    * fs/romfs:  Remove the rf_open flag.  It looks good, but actually
      does nothing.
    * fs/fat:  Remove the ff_open flag.  Same story as for the ROMFS
      rf_open flag.
    * fs/fat/fs_fat32.c, fs/nxffs/nxffs_initialize, and
      fs/nfs/nfs_vfsops.c:  Completed implementation of the dup() methods.
      There is still no good test available.
    * sched/sig_timedwait.c:  sigtimedwait() would return a bad signal
      number if the signal was already pending when the function was
      called.
    * configs/ubw32/scripts:  All common linker scripts moved to this
      scripts sub-directory
    * configs/ubw32/ostest:  Configuration configured to use the
      kconfig-frontends tools.
    * arch/mips/src/mips32/up_vfork.c, up_vfork.h, and vfork.S:
      Implement vfork() for MIPS32 (no floating point support)
    * configs/ubw32/ostest: Enable the vfork() test.
    * fs/binfs:  Move apps/builtin/binfs.c to fs/binfs/fs_binfs.c
      CONFIG_APPS_BINDIR rename CONFIG_FS_BINFS
    * include/nuttx/binfmt/builtin.h:  Some of the content of
      apps/include/apps.h moved to include/nuttx/binfmt/builtin.h
    * binfmt/libbuiltin/libbuiltin_utils.c:  Move builtin
      utility functions from apps/builtin/exec_builtins.c to
      binfmt/libbuiltin/libbuiltin_utils.c
    * binfmt/builtin.c and binfmt/libbuiltin:  Add a binary &quot;loader&quot;
      that can be used to execute builtin programs from the BINFS
      file system.
    * configs/sim/nsh: Convert to use kconfig-frontends configuration
      tool.
    * binfmt/binfmt_schedunload.c:  Add logic based on SIGCHLD to
      automatically unload and clean-up after running a task that
      was loaded into memory.
    * binfmt/libbuiltin: Extensions from Mike Smith
    * sched/task_reparent.c:  Add internal interface to change the
      parent task.
    * sched/task_posixspawn():  Move libc/spawn/lib_ps.c to
      sched/task_posixspawn() now it requires internal, reparenting
      interfaces
    * include/nuttx/spawn():  Move libc/spawn.h to include/nuttx/spawn.h
    * arch/arm/include/lpc17xx/chip.h, irq178x.h:  Integrate Marcelo
      Rommel's LPC1788 definitions into the base LPC17xx.
    * configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/nsh:  Convert configuration to use
      the kconfig-frontends tools.
    * sched/task_reparent.c:  Simplify reparenting interface.
    * arch/arm/src/[many]: More LPC1788 definitions from Rommel
      Marcelo incorporated.
    * configs/open1788:  Board configuration for the Wave Share
      Open1788 board.  Still fragmentary (contributed by Rommel
      Marcelo, adapted to use kconfig-frontends.
    * net/send():  Add logic to work around delayed ACKs by splitting
      packets (contributed by Yan T.).
    * net/recvfrom():  Fix a bug.  When the host closes a connection
      (gracefully).  recv[from]() returned success and the closure
      was never detected.  Hmmm.. I don't know why the network monitor
      did not catch this event.  This is an important bug fix.
    * net/recvfrom():  Fix a introduced with the last bugfix.  If
      the peer does an orderly closure of the socket, report 0 not
      -ENOTCONN
    * configs/lm3s6965-ek/README.txt and tools/:  Add an OpenOCD
      configuration for the LM3S (from Jose Pablo Carballo).
    * nuttx/lcd/hd4478ou.h and configs/pcblogic-pic32mx/src/up_lcd1602:
      Start of support of LCD1602 alphanumeric LCD.  I need a few
      more parts before I can finish integrating this one.
    * arch/arm/src/*/chip.h and arch/arm/include/*/chip.h:  Move all
      priority ranges from the src to the include chip.h header file.
    * arch/arm/include/armv7-m/irq.h:  Add inline functions to enable
      and disable interrupts via the BASEPRI register.
    * arch/arm/Kconfig:  Add new option CONFIG_ARM7VM_USEBASEI
    * arch/arm/src/*/*_irq.c:  Set the priority of the SVCALL exception
      to the highest possible value.
    * arch/armv7-m/up_hardfault.c:  Fail if a hardfault occurs
      while CONFIG_ARM7VM_USEBASEPRI=y.
    * arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_serial.c:  Add support for USART
      single wire mode (Contributed by the PX4 team).
    * sched/: Implement support for retaining child task status after
      the child task exists.  This is behavior required by POSIX.
      But in NuttX is only enabled with CONFIG_SCHED_HAVE_PARENT and
      CONFIG_SCHED_CHILD_STATUS
    * Add support for keyboard encode to the keypad test (from
      Denis Carikli).
    * configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/nettest:  Configuration converted to
      use the kconfig-frontends tools.
    * net/net_poll.c:  Split net_poll() to create psock_poll() too.
    * net/net_poll.c:  Fix poll/select issure reported by Qiang:
      poll_interrupt() must call net_lostconnection() when a
      loss of connection is reported.  Otherwise, the system will
      not know that the connection has been lost.
    * sched/group_create.c, group_join.c, and group_leave.c:  Add
      support for task groups.
    * sched/group_signal.c and task_exithook.c:  Send signal to all
      members for the parent task group.
    * include/nuttx/sched.h and sched/env_*.c:  Move environment
      variables into task group structure.
    * sched/: Lots of file changed.  Don't keep the parent task's
      task ID in the child task's TCB.  Instead, keep the parent
      task group IN the child task's task group.
    * fs/, sched/, include/nuttx/sched.h, and include/nutts/fs/fs.h:
      Move file data from the TCB to the task group structure.
    * libc/stdio/, sched/, include/nuttx/lib.h, and include/nutts/fs/fs.h:
      Move stream data from the TCB to the task group structure.
    * net/, sched/, and include/nuttx/net/net.h:  Move socket data
      from the TCB to the task group structure.
    * sched/task_starthook.c, sched/task_start.c, and include/nuttx/sched.h:
      Add a task start hook that will be called before the task main
      is started. This can be used to schedule C++ constructors to run
      automatically in the context of the new task.
    * binfmt/binfmt_execmodule: Execute constructors as a start hook.
    * sched/os_start.c: Fix ordering of group initialization.
    * configs/stm32f4discovery/usbnsh:  Add an NSH STM32F4Discovery
      configuration that uses USB CDC/ACM for the NSH console.
    * configs/stm32f4discovery/nsh: Converted to use the kconfig-frontends
      tools.
    * configs/*/src/up_userleds.c: Fix a error that was cloned into
      all STM32 user LED code.  The wrong definitions were being used
      to set LEDs on or off.
    * arch/*/common/up_internal.h and arch/*/common/up_initialize.c:
      Serial was driver was not being built if there is no console
      device.  Obviously, the serial driver may be needed even in
      this case.
    * arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_serial.c: If there is a serial console,
      it would be ttyS0 and the others would be ttyS1-5.  If there
      is not serial console, was labeling them ttyS1-6; now labels them
      ttyS0-5.
    * fs/fs_syslog.c: Can't handle SYSLOG output to character device from
      the IDLE task (because it can't block). syslog_putc now returns EOF
      on failure and sets errno.  Fixed some errors in error handling.
    * libc/stdio/lib_syslogstream.c:  Checking of return value from
      syslog_putc was bogus.  Switching to EOF for all errors solves
      this.
    * arch/arm/src/lm/chip/lm4f_memorymap.h: More LM4F changes from
      Jose Pablo Carballo.
    * drivers/serial/serial.c, include/nuttx/serial/serial.h,
      drivers/usbdev/cdcacm.c, and drivers/pl2303.c: Add support for
      removable serial devices (like USB serial).  This support is enabled
      by CONFIG_SERIAL_REMOVABLE.
    * arch/*/src/*/Toolchain.defs: Change assignment so that we can
      override CROSSDEV with a make command line argument.
    * include/assert.h:  Mark assertion functions as non-returning.
    * arch/*/src/*/up_assert.h:  Mark _up_assert() as non-returning.
    * drivers/mtd/at25.c: When the AT25 device was not available the
      initialization did not fail like it should. From Petteri Aimonen.
    * fs/fat/fs_configfat.c:  Fix some errors in FAT formatting logic
      for large devices and for FAT32. From Petteri Aimonen.
    * fs/fat/fs_fat32util.c:  Fix an initialization error found by
      Petteri Aimonen.  freecount and next freecount initialization were
      reversed.
    * drivers/mmcsd/mmcsd_spi.c: Some SD cards will appear busy until
      switched to SPI mode for first time.  Having a pull-up resistor on
      MISO may avoid this problem, but this patch makes it work also
      without pull-up.  From Petteri Aimonen.
    * fs/fat/fs_fat32.c: Fix a compilation error when FAT_DMAMEMORY=y. 
      From Petteri Aimonen.
    * arch/arm/src/stm32/chip/stm32_spi.h: STM32F4 max SPI clock freq is
      37.5 MHz.  Patch from Petteri Aimonen.
    * arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_spi.c: Fixes for SPI DMA work on the
      STM32F4. Includes untested additions for the F1 implementation as
      well.  From Petteri Aimonen.

apps-6.25 2013-02-01 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * Makefiles: Removed dependency of distclean on clean in most top-level
      files.  It makes sense for 'leaf' Makefiles to have this dependency,
      but it does not make sense for upper-level Makefiles.
    * apps/namedapp/: Renamed to builtins in preparation for another change.
    * .context:  Removed the .context kludge.  This caused lots of problems
      when changing configurations because there is no easy way to get the
      system to rebuild the context.  Now, the context will be rebuilt
      whenever there is a change in either .config or the Makefile.
    * apps/builtin/registry:  Updated new built-in registration logic to handle
      cases where (1) old apps/.config is used, and (2) applications ared
      removed, not just added.
    * apps/examples/nettest/Makefile:  Fix an error that crept in during
      some of the recent, massive build system changes.
    * apps/builtin/Makefile:  Need to have auto-generated header files
      in place early in the dependency generation phase to avoid warnings.
      It is not important if they are only stubbed out header files at
      this build phase.
    * apps/examples/hidbkd: Now supports decoding of encoded special keys
      if CONFIG_EXAMPLES_HIDKBD_ENCODED is defined.
    * apps/examples/hidbkd:  Add support for decoding key release events
      as well.  However, the USB HID keyboard drier has not yet been
      updated to detect key release events.  That is kind of tricky in
      the USB HID keyboard report data.
    * apps/examples/wlan: Remove non-functional example.
    * apps/examples/ostest/vfork.c:  Added a test of vfork().
    * apps/exampes/posix_spawn: Added a test of posix_spawn().
    * apps/examples/ostest:  Extend signal handler test to catch
      death-of-child signals (SIGCHLD).
    * apps/examples/ostest/waitpid.c:  Add a test for waitpid(), waitid(),
      and wait().
    * builtin/binfs.c:  Add hooks for dup() method (not implemented).
    * builtin/exec_builtin.c, nshlib/nsh_parse.c, and nshlib/nsh_builtin.c:
      NSH now supports re-direction of I/O to files (but still not from).
    * builtin/binfs.c:  Greatly simplified (it is going to need to be
      very lightweight).  Now supports open, close, and a new ioctl to recover
      the builtin filename.  The latter will be needed to support a binfs
      binfmt.
    * builtin/binfs.c:  Move apps/builtin/binfs.c to fs/binfs/fs_binfs.c
      CONFIG_APPS_BINDIR rename CONFIG_FS_BINFS
    * apps/include/builtin.h:  Some of the content of
      apps/include/apps.h moved to include/nuttx/binfmt/builtin.h.
      apps/include/apps.h renamed builtin.h
    * apps/builtin/exec_builtins.c:  Move builtin
      utility functions from apps/builtin/exec_builtins.c to
      binfmt/libbuiltin/libbuiltin_utils.c
    * apps/nshlib/nsh_mountcmds.c:  The block driver/source
      argument is now optional.  Many files systems do not need
      a source and it is really stupid to have to enter a bogus
      source parameter.
    * apps/nshlib/nsh_fileapp.c:  Add the ability to execute a file
      from a file system using posix_spawn().
    * apps/builtin/: Extensions from Mike Smith.
    * apps/examples/ftpd/Makefile: Name ftpd_start is not the name of
      the entrypoint.  Should be ftpd_main (from Yan T.)
    * apps/netutils/telnetd/telnetd_driver: Was stuck in a loop if
      recv[from]() ever returned a value &lt;= 0.
    * apps/examples/nettest and poll:  Complete Kconfig files.
    * apps/examples/ostest/waitpid.c:  Need to use WEXITSTATUS()
      to decode the correct exit status.
    * apps/system/usbmonitor:  A daemon that can be used to monitor USB
      trace outpout.
    * apps/nshlib/nsh_usbdev.c, nsh_consolemain.c, nsh_session.c, nsh_script.c:
      Add support for a login script.  The init.d/rcS script will be executed
      once when NSH starts; the .nshrc script will be executed for each session:
      Once for serial, once for each USB connection, once for each Telnet
      session.
    * apps/system/readline: Correct readline() return value.  Was not
      any returning special values when end-of-file or read errors
      occur (it would return an empty string which is not very useful).

NxWidgets-1.5 2013-02-01 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * NxWidgets::CGraphicsPort::move():  Fix typo bug in bounding rectangle
      calculation (from Petteri Aimonen).
    * NxWM::CScrollingPanel::scrollChildren(): Avoid unnecessary redraws in
      CScrollingPanel (contributed by Petteri Aimonen).
    * NxWM::CCycleButton:  Remove the separator from CCycleButton. It draws in
      wrong place, and doesnt look very good in the correct place either.
      (from Petteri Aimonen).
    * NxWidgets::CGraphicsPort: Many times we only want a constant background.
      In that case the old code fills the background, reads it back, renders
      the text and then writes it back. When used with LCD's (instead of
      framebuffers) this causes unnecessary delay and screen flicker.
      This commit adds a variant of drawText that takes background color,
      so that the background and text can both be rendered at one go.
      The old functions still function as before (Petteri Aimonen).
    * NxWidgets::CLabel: The label was drawn as a single rectangular region,
      then a text was added to the on top of this.  The result is that the
      text would flicker when the CLabel was updated. With this change, the
      two step update is replaced with a five step update:  The background
      is updated as four rectangulear regions (leaving the previous text in
      place), then the new text is updated.  This eliminates the flicker
      (Petteri Aimonen).
    * Kconfig: Many NxWidgets/NxWM settings do not have meaningful, generic
      default values.  Colors, for example, depend on pixel depth.  Some
      geometry settings depending on other geometry settings.  Font IDs are
      not know-able by the configuration system.  etc.  In these cases, it
      is best if the settings are just not undefined so that the system can
      calculate a reasonable default.  however, if no default is provided
      in the .config file, mconf will complain and generate errors.  So work
      around this, I added several &quot;enabling&quot; settings to override the
      default setting.  This is awkward and I preferred the configuration as
      it was before, but this avoids the mconf errors and warnings.
    * UnitTests:  Changed occurrences of lib_rawprintf() and lib_lowprintf()
      to match recent changes to NuttX (will be in NuttX-6.25)
    * CGraphicsPort::_drawText:  Renamed from CGraphicsPort::drawText in order
      to eliminate some naming collisions when overloaded in some configurations
      (i.e., when both bool and nx_pixel_t are uint8_t).  From Petteri Aimonen.
    * CNxWidgets::drawContents: Change base drawContents from a do-nothing
      function to a function that fills the widget with the background color.
      This is useful when using CNxWidgets as a &quot;panel&quot; , i.e. a container
      for other widgets. Subclasses will override drawContents and decide
      themselves how to draw the background.
    * CNxWidgets::CTabPanel:  A new widget contributed by Petteri Aimonen.
      This widget provides a tab panel, which has a button bar at the top
      and panels below it. Pressing a button will select the corresponding
      panel.

uClibc++-1.0 2011-11-05 &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * The initial release of the uClibc++ implementation of the standard
      C++ library for NuttX.  This package was contributed ay Qiang Yu and
      David for the RGMP team.

buildroot-1.11 2011-11-05 &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * configs/avr-defconfig-4.3.3 - Added --enable-long-long as a GCC
      option.
    * configs/avr-defconfig-4.5.2 - New configuration.
    * Config.in and almost all configurations in configs/ - Changed the
      default nuttx path to $(TOPDIR)/../../nuttx
    * Misc files.  Patch provided by Gerd v. Egidy that solves the following
      problems
      - binutils 2.21 is not available on the gnu servers anymore, they replaced
        it with 2.21.1
      - there is some assembler error when compiling gcc for arm, gcc bugzilla
        43999
      - you can't build nuttx for cortex m3/m4 because of a missing instruction
        in the assembler, binutils bugzilla 12296
    * Add support for binutils 2.22 and GCC 4.6.3.
    * Change name of all tools from xxx-elf to xxx-nuttx-elf
    * Added an ARM EABI GCC 4.6.3 configuration (tool name is arm-nuttx-eabi-).
    * ldnxflat: Add support for the R_ARM_REL32 relocation.  This relocation
      type was not generated by GCC/LD prior to gcc-4.6.3
    * R_ARM_REL32 logic is conditionally disabled because it has not been
      tested.
    * ldnxflat: Correct a memory allocation error that could cause written
      past the end of allocated memory.  Partial restoration of R_ARM_REL32
      logic.  There are lots of issues that I still do not understand here.

pascal-3.0 2011-05-15 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * nuttx/:  The Pascal add-on module now installs and builds under the
      apps/interpreters directory.  This means that the pascal-2.1 module is
      incompatible with will all releases of NuttX prior to nuttx-6.0 where the 
      apps/ module was introduced.
