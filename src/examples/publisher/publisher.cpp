	 * is subscribing. After this advertise() call is made, the master
	 * node will notify anyone who is trying to subscribe to this topic name,
	 * and they will in turn negotiate a peer-to-peer connection with this
	 * node.  advertise() returns a Publisher object which allows you to
	 * publish messages on that topic through a call to publish().  Once
	 * all copies of the returned Publisher object are destroyed, the topic
	 * will be automatically unadvertised.
	 *
	 * The second parameter to advertise() is the size of the message queue
	 * used for publishing messages.  If messages are published more quickly
	 * than we can send them, the number here specifies how many messages to
	 * buffer up before throwing some away.
